Ver. 9. EPJSTLE To THE coLossmNS. 121

dued with the gift of divine wisdom will immediately af-
firm that he is. Now let it be involved in special difficul-
ties, VVhether he is so our only Mediator, that he has not
communicated the office of interceding to his glorious
mother and to other saints; or whether he is so our Media-
tor, that he alone hath made satisfaction for our sins, hav-
ing left no part of the satisfaction to be made by us. Now
there will be need of understanding, i. e. of the clearness
of wisdom, which, if wanting, we shall easily fall into
error.

Let it be also enquired, Whether it is lawful for subjecte
to bear arms against their Sovereign3 even every Papist
will immediately answer it is not lawful. Now let particu-
larcircumstances be added: Is it lawful by- force of arms
to oppose their king when condemned for heresy, and ex·-
communicated by the order of the Pope? If the gift of
understanding be wanting, every Papist will doubt and
vacillate3 nay, he will break out into open rebellion, as
we have seen testified by experience.—You perceive what
wisdom is, what understanding, and what is their differ-
ence.

Now, iu the last place, is it asked Whenee these gifts
come to us? The Apostle points out that in one word,
when he adds spiritual.

Spiritual] But it is called so, because it is produced
‘by the spirit of Christ, not acquired by our ability. For
the uncreated Wisdom of God, is the Author of this creat-
ed wisdomfi* In Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, and the rest
of the heathen writers, that wisdom in which they excelled
was an acquired habit3 but in the faithful, saving wisdoln
is an infused habit. Ifany laclc wisdom, let him asle osGod,
wlco givetlz to all men liberally, Jas. i. 5. Whence says Cle-
mens, Wz‘sdom cannot be bought with earthlgs coin; nor is it
sold in the marlcet, but in heaven, Paedag, lib. ii. cap. 3.

From these considerations we deduce some inferences.

¹· It may be perniitted to refer the Reader to a splendid illustration os
the nature and excellent-ies of this wisdom in Ecclesiasticus xxiv.
