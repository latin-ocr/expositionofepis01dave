Christ of the chief glory of creation: for those invisible
substances are far more dignified than the visible. They
lop off the most noble part of the creation. They oppose
the most evident experienoe, which bath concluded upon
the existence both of good and evil spirits, from the va-
110115 effects that cannot be produced otherwise than by
spiritual beings.

Let us, therefore, rejecting at once all these 011015, cona

The Apostle had before asserted that Christ was the Maker
of all things, as well visible as invisible z Now he illustrates
and extends that assertion by a new snb-division of the in-
visible creatures. But it must be observed, that the ab-
stract is here put for the concrete: for by dominions, primis
palities, and powers, we are to understand angels appointed
to dominion, principality, and power3 that is, governors
and princes, ,

Melancthon thinks, that under these denominations, not
only all orders of invisible angels, but all governments,
and the whole range of created things, of civil and domes-
tic polities, are included. According, therefore, to his
interpretation& the Apostle teacheS, that all the creatures
were not only made, but arranged by Christ3 so that those
which presided over others, both in heaven and in earth, are
still in subjectioni to him, because all degrees of pre-emi-
nence and command are arranged and appointed by him.

⁸ Aloslzez'm says of hIelancthon, that ‘⁵ by 1115 example, influence, 31111
instructions, many were greatly animated ς and that his sentiments relating
both to sacred and profane eruditiori, were so universally respected, that
scarcely any had the courage to oppose thein.'' The 31111315 of antiquity in-
deed, present few worthies that may be compared to him. With 3 mind
stored with every species of learning, and competent to engage in any dis-
quisition on literature or religion, he rendered more signal advantages in his
time to each than, perhaps, any of the other doctors of the age. Though
most intrepid when the cause of religion was in peril, and of unshaken con-
stancy in the honr of trial, yet he was pre-eminently distinguished by a
love of peace and concord. A fellow labourer with Luther in the Reforma-
tion, his remains were deposited close by that Champion'S, and an elegant
epitaph was inscribed on his tomb by the learned Beza; which, as acompen-
dium of his character, a snininary of 1115 excellences, and a testimony
