294 ΛΝ Exi‘oSlTlON OF sT. PAUL's Clzap. i.

Hence came those extravagances of the Papists, that the
Pope is superior to all councils; that the Pope is infallible
in matters of faith3 that those who do not submit to the
Roman Pontiff are not in a state of salvation3 that all in-
terpretation of Scripture is to be derived from the reposi-
tory of his breast3 with many other absurdities of this na-
ture. From all which itis clear that he claims not for him-
self tlze pastoral office in the Church, but assumes kz'ngly
dominion.

3. Inasmuch as Paul assigned the ministerial office laid
upon him, as a reason why he ought to rejoice in his affiic-

than unjust persecution, whilst they are discharging, and
because they do discharge the duties of their calling. For
as wounds, and even death itself, are glorious to a soldier

busy body in other men’s matters: but ff any man suffer as a
Christian, lec him uot be aslzamed, but let him glorify God our
this behalf, l Pet. iv. 15, 16. And thus fai· as to the office
itself: It next follows as to the Author of the office.

According to tlze dispensatim qf God] The Apostle shews
in these words the authority by which he was made a nii-
nister of the Church, viz. by the ordinance of God himself.
In this place, then, by the words, the dispensation of God,
he understands a lawful and defined power given to him by
God for dispensing and administering the spiritual things
pertaining to the Church. For the Church is the household
