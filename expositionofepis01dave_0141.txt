Ver. 3. EPISTLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 55

they celebrate the benignity of Him' who bestows spiritual
gifts on men. Now who that is, is declared3

To God and the Fatlzer of our Lord, &c.] Here the per-
son is described to whom thanks are presented by the
Apostle. And he is described as well by his absolute
name, that it is God3 as by his relative title, that it is the
Fatlzer of Christ. The Apostle employs both with the best

design.

In the first place, he gives thanks to God because He is
the Giver of all good: but although he designates the first
person in the Trinity, yet 116 (1065 not exclude the rest.
For the works of the Trinitas, as it respects things externa& are
mzdivided. Therefore what God the Father gives to the
creature, the same the Son gives, and the Holy Spirit.
But because the first person is the fountain of Deity‚ there· ‘
fore the rest are understood where he is named.

Observe, l. From the apostolic example, we here learn,
in all ourjoy for good things bestowed either upon our-
selves or others, that the recollection of God ought in-
stantly to occur to us3 because whatever isjoyful and sa-
lutary comes of his beneficence.

2. We are admonished of this, that it behoves us, as
often as we observe any one adorned with remarkable gifts
from God, to break out into the praises of God and to
giving of thanks : for God will have this payment of praises
and thanks to be rendered to him, by all those who hold
his benefits‚ as a recognition of his supreme dominion.
So the Psalmist, cxvi. 12, 13, says, What shall I render
wito the Lordfor all his benefits towards me? I will take the
cup (ff salvation, and will call upon the name qf tlze Lord.
Every man is bound in the debt of honour (as the School-
men say), to render something to that person who has done
him a favour. But God needs not our good things3 we
should therefore render to him what is his own, i. e. the
glory of his benefits. If we are unwilling to do this, as he
who does not acknowledge his feudal lord, by this crime of
ingratitude 10565 his copyhold3 so he who does not ac-
knowledge God, the Author of his good, may in justice
be deprived of that good.
