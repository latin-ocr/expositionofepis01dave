saith he, ‘ in that Synod is held unlawful:’ and again, ‘ the
Synod of Dort‚ in some points condemneth, by the bye‚ even the
discipline of the Church of England.’

“ VVas that distressed Church,* in the midst of her distractions
about matter of doctrine, so wily in her intentions, as to make
preposterous use of their neighbour’s assistance, and to draw
them in for concurrence, in matter of discipline, with a foreign
sister, against their own Mother? Were those that then aided
that Church tam naris obesae, so dull of apprehension as not to
perceive the interest of their own? or did they demean themselves
tam sublestafide, so perfidiously, as to suffer the government of
this renowned Church, so much as ‘ by the bye,' to be condemned

pleased the Appealer or Appeacher, before he recorded in print
such his odious information, tendered to his Majesty’s own hands,

‘ let them that are interested plead for themselves? We‚rthere-
fore, who have hereunto subscribed our names, being ‘ interested’
in that Synod, and withal deeply in this crimination of ‘ Puritan-
ism‚' can do no less than answer, and clear, in some public man-
ner, this slander published against us.

“ And first, in yeneral, to remove the often objected suspicion
of complication between ‘ Foreign Doctrine’ and ‘ Foreign Dis-
cipline ;' whereby is intended that there is a kind of natural con·
sanguinity between that Doctrine which odiously he styleth ‘ Fo-
reign,’ subscribed unto by that Synod, and the Presbyterian Dis-
cipline established in that and other Foreign Churches ;——
