of salvation‚ God is also willing that they should receive
it3 but hc wills it with a will approving; not with a will

ad Capit. Gall. respons. 5, observes, The effect upon those
wlzose outward ears are salated by (ι bodz'ly voice, is a different
thing from the effect upon those whose iuwcml sense God leatlz

With these riches this niystery of the Gospel is filled.

Gospel, the whole world would be in misery, in want, 111
beggary. Men, being blind, do not perhaps feel this their
spiritual indigence3 but that insensibility does not lessen
their want3 as it is said Rev. iii. 17, Thou sayest, I am rich,
and increasecl willa goods, and lzave need (ff notlzz'ng; ancl
