Ver. 25. EPISTLE To THE cotoss1ANs. :293

In this verse it is used in that more extensive significa-
tion3 yet so as not to express any thing less dignified than
the Apostolic ministry: for the office committed to Paul
was tlie apostleship, as appears from the words. For he
does not say that he is made a minister of this or that par-
ticular Church‚ but of the Church universal, namely of
that which in the foregoing verse he had called the body (ff
Christ. Now from this mention of his office, and this title
of minister which Paul assumeS, let us deduce a few obser-
vations.

l. The circumstance that Paul, who was constitu-
ted an Apostle, should speak of himself as a Minister of
the Church, is an excitement to those whohave obtained
the higher situations in the Church, to activity3 and ad·-
monishes them to think more of their duties than their ho-
nour3 and of the task imposed upon them, rather than the
<lignity attached to it. We, alas! on the contrary, are
more willing to be called pastors, than studious to be suclz .· we
cti-oid tlze laevom-s qf' our office, but are eager to obtain ics Ιιο-
nonrs, as Prosper laniented of old, De vit. contemp. lib. i.
cap. 21. But we should always recollect, that the very
term minister, is rather a title of labour than of dignity.

2. We also infer hence, that those who have the supe-
riority in the Church, have but a ministry, and not an ab·
solute dominion. [ am made Α MiNisTER of the Charch,
says the Apostle, not, α lord. Ministers should not, like
earthly potentates, lord it, either over the persons or the
consciences of Christians. This Peter forbids in l Epis.
v. 2, 3, Feed tlaeefloclc of God which is among you, not as being
fords (ff tlte lzeritage‚ bnt being examples to tlte θοοῖς. And
Paul expresses his aversion to it, 2 Cor. i. 24, Not that we
leave donzinz'on over yoztrfait-lz, bnt are helpers, διο. The Ro-
man Pontiff, therefore, who makes himself, not the minis-
ter, but tlte lord and God of the Church, is no successor
either of Paul or of Peter. For, he desires to mle, at least
by an indirect dominion, over both the persons and pro-
perty of all ChristianS, and even of kings themselves3 and
by a direct dominion over their faith and consciences, as
sar as he imagines that heis constituted a spiritual monarch.
