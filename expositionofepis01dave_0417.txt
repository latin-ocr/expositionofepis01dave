working of Christ, operating in his mind, adorned and en-
riched Paul. Others are to render a Minister firm and
ready to endure any thing for the Gospel: of this kind are
fortitude, constancy, patience, zeal for the Divine glory,
and all those other virtues with which the soul is upheld
and sustained in undergoing afflictions. We are able also
to add a third kind of effects, which are to promote the
success of the Gospel, and to procure for the Apostles
themselves extraordinary authority: namely, the power of
working miracles, which some interpreters think to be in-

2. No one should be deterred from the pastoral office
on account of those injuries and reproaches which are wont
to be heaped upon Ministers: for the Spirit of Christ will
be with them strengthening them to endure all things even
withjoyfulness. In the world με shall have tribulution, buc
in me γε shall have peace, says Christ. John xvi. 33. There
shall be from nie an inward consolation to revive you, as
long as there shall be an outward tyranny from the world to
crush you.

but hurried along by that of the devil, who, when pressed
