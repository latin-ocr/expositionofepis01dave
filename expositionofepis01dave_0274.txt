188 ΑΝ EXPOSlTION or ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

For by him were all things created] He here gives the
reason why he had termed Christ the first-born (J every
creat-are. And his reason, as the Schoolmen will have it,
is derived ἆ caasa exemplari ; from his being the ideal
cause, or the cause as a model. And they infer this be-
cause it is said, ἐν ἀυτ-αῖ, in him ,· not aemma, hy him. And
here they philosophize at large about the eternal idea of all
things in the Word. Nor, indeed, do we ourselves (leny
that the Maker of the world, had in himself from all eter-
nity‚ the pians of all things ready described, so that all
things were present to the Word, though not present in
themselves. For as the philosopher says, 7 Metaph. de
rebus artificialibus, Theform (ff those things must leave ex-
isted in the mind of the workman, before they could have been
exhibited z'n the worlcmanship; as every material house is al—
ways built according to the immaterial pattern which was al-
ready planned in the mind oflhe architect .· so concerning the
system of nature, we may with truth assert‚ that the plan
or scheme of all things must have existed in the Divine
mind and arrangement before they were actually produced.

Now if in this manner we explain the words of the Apos-
tle, ἐν 'aufto ’eurzSn πάντα, in him were all things crealed‚ we
obtain the strongest proof of Christ being prior to, and
inore excellent than all creatures3 inasmuch as the ideal
cause is always prior to that which is made according to
it. I have chosen to notice this interpretation of the
Schoolmen, because there is no fallacy in it: but I am my-
self much more inclined to the opinion of Chrysostom, and
our writers, who regard this expression as a Hebraism, and
say that ἐν ἀινῖω and δῖ’ὶκυτὸυ have the same meaning, so
that the reason is derived from the efficient cause. For
this preposition in is often taken forper in the Scriptures.
Hoc genus daemoniorum non ejicitur nisi in jejunio ᾗῇ this
kind (of evil spirits) can comeforth by nothing bnt byfasting.
So 1 Cor. xii. to speak in the Spirit, and to receive gifts in
the spirit, are certainly used in each case for by the spirit
[as expressed in our English Bibles]. And Ithe more wil—
