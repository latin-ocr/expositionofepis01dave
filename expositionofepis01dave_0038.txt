xxviii ΗΒΕ OF BisHOP DAVENAN'I'.

prosecute our appeal from the rash sentence of this Appellant;
alleging for ourselves

“ l. Though all and singular the articles there comprised had
passed Synodical scrutiny‚ and been approved canonically‚ yet
will it not follow that all and every one of the Synodicks there
gave consent thereto. For this approbation might have passed by
the votes of the major part, etiam reclamantibus Britannis, who
for number were not considerable, among so many others, both
strangers and provincials. And so a favour-able construction
might have exempted the Eritish Divines from being thought to
reach forth their hand to the striking their mother.

“ 2 We deny, that, upon view of those Synodical acts, we,
by presumption in law, need to be put upon purgationi herein, as
members involved in a capitular decree of the whole body. For,
in point of discipline there passed no act at all; there was no
proposition made; as evidently appeareth by the same book of
the Synodical Acts, in the narration of the proceedings about this
Belgick confession 3 where the matter subjected to deliberation, is
recorded with limitation ; first, positive, ‘ quae ad dogmata δι doc-
trinae essentiam pertinerent3 points doymatical and pertainz‘ng to
the essence of doctrine :'——then exclusive, ‘ Monituin proinde fuit
eo ternpore articulum trigesimum primum et secundum non esse
examinandum, quia in utroque de ordine ecclesiastico quem exteri
nonnulli a nostro diversum habent, ageretur. Declaratz‘on ωας
accor'clinyly made, at the same time, that the thirty-first and se-
cond articles were not to be examined; because z'n them ecclesias-
tical order, or clm-rell 9ουενηῃιεηῐ, was leandled; wherez'n some
stranyem} namely, the Church of England ‘ differ fromvourss
namely, from that of the Church of the Netherlands. This re-
corded testimony of so express withdrawing from the eye of the
Synod all view of church discipline, might demonstrate, to any
indifferent peruser of those acts, that whereas no possibility of
Synodical condemning, so much as ‘ hy the ὀρθᾷ the discipline of
the Church of England‚ in such examining the Belgick Confes-
sion. ἦ·

“ As for our manner of examining and judging thereos, though
it be not so particularly set down in the said printed acts as we
could have wished, and would have provided for, had we been
made acquainred with any intent of their publication ; yet is it in
some sort touched in the same page, in that very narration of the
next sessioni, testisying a cautelous dclivcry of our judgments.
