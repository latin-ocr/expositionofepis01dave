but that sacrifices might be offered to angels or departed
patriarchs in token of gratitude and obedience towards
mediators and intercessors.

3.‘ To erect a temple (i. e. a house of prayer and of
religious worship), to raise altars, and offer incense in
honour of any one, is to pay Divine honour to him. Con-
cerning temples‚ Augustine, Contra Max. Arian, remarks,
ff we were to erect a temple to an angel, we should be anathe-
matizedfrom tlze trutlz of Christ and the (ἶΙιιινσΙιἸ qf God. So
concerning altars ς Au altar is that which testffies that ke to
whom v‘t is erected is accounted a God. Concerning incense
it is evident as well among the heathen as the Jews, that it
was a token of Divine honour ordained forihis own worship
by God, Exod. xxx„ 37. All these the antient heretics as-

this honour to himself, Mv house shall be called the lzouse of
prayer, Matth. xxi. 13. Concerning altars, the same author
confesses‚ they are dedicated to saints, but not with the
purport of an altar, but of a monument or sepulchre.
But what rnadness is this to refer those things to other
respects and inferior worship which God himself in his
word, hath confined to the worship of latria? Lastly,
concerning incense, the same Bellarmin concedes, that
sweet odours are burnt to the images whether of angels or
of saints: But these ceremonies (as hath been said) refer
to the outward acts of latria. We conclude, therefore‚with
the Apostle, as well against antient heretics as these new
ones, Let no man beguileyou into the worshz'pping of angels
orofsaints; for what is peculiar to God is rendered to
creatures by both. Let us proceed, and dismiss the rest
briefly.
