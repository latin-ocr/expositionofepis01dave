Ver. 13. erisne: To THE COLosslANS. 459

teth out thy sins for my name's salse, Isa. xliii. 25, Now,
forgivenesses of sins which are said to be made by men,
are either remissions of injuries, or abatement of satisfac-
tion‚ or of other things which are in the power of man, οι·
evangelical promises of the remissiori of sins on the pre-
vious supposition of faith and true penitence: but forgive-
ness of eterna! punishment is not in human power. The
papal priests may sprinkle holy water upon sinners, but
(as Parisiensis learnedly remarks, de Universo 2. 2. cap.
148) they have not tlze water of divine grace in their power, by
which alone tlze washing away of sins is ffcted. The minis-
ters of the Gospel also may use their keys to absolve men
from their sins: but how ’.ἱ Hear Durandus, out of Lom-
bard, lib. 4. dist. 18, God puls away sin by himself, by wash?
ing the soul from z'ts stain of gnilt, and by relaxing the debtof
punishmeut; priests absolve, by shewing that the remission is
made or not made. The sacerdotal absolution, therefore,
hath then force, when it is made by the unerring key, as
the Schoolmen rightly observe.

2. The Papists err, who would have the punishments
due to sin, according to the Divine righteousness, to be
expiated either by the proper satisfactions of the indivi-
duals, or to be relaxed by papal indulgences ε for these de-
vices oppose gratuitous remission. For, if to remit be not
to charge with punishment, gratuitous remissiori is not
granted us where just punishment or satisfaction is requir-
ed from us· These additions of human satisfactions also
oppose the dignity of the satisfaction exhibited by Christ;
for Christ, by submitting to punishment without any fault,
hath delivered us both from the guilt and the punishment.

3. As universal remissiori of sins is always granted on
God's part, so also there ought to be in us an universal
detestation of sin. And, doubssess, that is most true, that
there is always found in every truly reconciled man an
hatred of all his sins, and also a purpose and aim hence·
forward to abstain from all. For he who hath received re-
mission of all, hath received at the same time the infusion
of grace, which arms and fortifies him against all. He,
therefore, who cherishes, as it were, in the bottom of his
