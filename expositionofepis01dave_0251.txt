Ver. 14. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSMNS. 165

Thus much concerning the Redeemer, viz. Christ the

prises and explains what he understands by redemption : for

merited for us ε but he would not bestow upon believers at
once this incorruption of their bodies, and deliverance
from present external misen-ies, and from the remains of
sin, for the following reasons ;

First, lest the condition-of the head and of the inembers
should be plainly dissimilar. For Christ himself was α
man of sorrows, having endured every kind of misery: he
did not at once sit down at the right hand of the Father
in glory, but first undervvent hunger, thirst, crucifixion,
and death: it is therefore but consistent, that the members
