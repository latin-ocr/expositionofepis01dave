is inexplicable. It is manifestly the production of an inferior pen,
and is decidedly adverse to his views, as stated through the rest
of the volume. The Editor, T. Β., Ι conceive to be one Thomas
Bedford, who, in the same year (1650), at the suggestion of
Archbishop Usher, published‚ along with two divinity Theses of
his own, a letter of Bishop Davenant's to Dr. lVard, entitled

Epistola de Sacramentis.
ln sending up the two Dissertationes above-mentioned to Abp.

Usher, Dr. Edward Davenant says, “ I have sent up that elaborate
work of the Bishop of Salisbury, which, being committed to my
charge, your Grace has done me unspeakable favour to undertake the
publishing· of it. . . ‚The short answer of his unto the French Di-
vines, which Ι found scattered among his papers, is sent up in this
books* The regard of Usher and Davenant appears to have been
reciprocal. The former, in writing to Dr. Ward, says, ‘⁶ For the
Arminian Quesfflon, Ι desire never to read more than my Lord of
Salisbury’s Lectures, touching Predestination and Christ’s Death.’'
And again, “ Ithauk you most heartily for communicating my
Lord of Salisbury’s Lectures. They are excellent: learnedIy,
soundly, and perspicuously performed3 and, Ι hope, will do much
good for the establishing of our young divines in the present
truth.'’

Few men appear to have been more honoured and venerated by
all parties than Bishop Davenant. In all the works of friends or
opponents, there is not to be found a single sentence approaching
even to disrespect‚ much less any thing that can tend to cast the
slightest reflexion upon his deportment in any measure of his pub-
lic or private life. His profound learning, acuteness of intellect,
catholic spirit, active benevolence, and meekness, are constantly
adverted to; and the phrases—‘⁶ the good ssishop Davenant,'' the
“ excellent Bishop Davenant‚'' the ‘⁴ learned Pishop Davenant‚”
ἃς. &c. are the usual appendages to his name, even in the writ-
ings of those who took up the pen in express hostility to certain
of his theological views.

³¹⁸ In 1641, the year of the Bishop’s decease, the learned Dr. Ger-ard
Langbaine published, at Oxford, a book, eutitled “ Episcop.tl iliberitanae,
or a reply to the humble exauiination ofa printed Abstract, and the
answers to nine reasons of the House of Commons against the Votes of
Bishops in Parliament. To which is added a Determination of the late
learned Bishop of Salisbury, Englished.'' This was reprinted in 1680,
in London, but Ι have not been able to obtain the book.
