4²34 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

peccatis carnis exuto, the body of tlzefleslz being freed from
sins. He, therefore, takes the word body properly, and
says, this our body is freed from the sins of the flesh by
the circumcision of Christ. But Erasmus, and almost all
other interpreters thus 3 whilst με lzaveput qfftlze body ‹ftlze
sins of tlzefleslw or, in the pulling away of the body of tlze
sins of thefleslz. They, therefore, take the word body me-
taphorically‚ for that mass of native corruption in which
we are involved: and they think the word flesh is added
that he might signify whence that body of sins hath its
origin and motion3 namely, from carnal generation, and
from the carnal part of man, that is to say, from that part
which is not yet regenerated. This interpretation, as it is

this? An inward circumcision wrought by the Spirit of
Christ. These two clauses are, therefore, to be joined, the
circumcision made without hands, and tlze circumcision of
Clzrist; and both are to be referred to the mode of our cir-
cumcision. 3· From the different effect: the Jewish cir-
cumcision cut off the foreskin of the flesh; ours, the whole
body of sin.

stress upon it, to teach the Colossians they had no need of
