320 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. 13110135 Clzap.i.

which are essential to the full understanding of each, as
well as to refute all conflicting errors. As to the doctrine
of grace, no one doubts but that it is the special duty of a
Minister of the Gospel to unfold all its mysteries3 and as
to tlze law, it is evident that he ought to instruct the peo-
ple of God in the true knowledge of it. For the law is the
dictate of the Divine mind, and the rule of the human will
and operation-5 and every one is bound to make himself
acquainted with that rule to which his life ought to be con-
formed.

But in teaching on this point it is so easy to err, that
some cautioris may be useful. We must be careful, then,
in setting forth the doctrine of the law, not to suffer men's
minds to rest upon it, as if they were to obtain salvation
by obeying it3 but they must be led to the throne of
Christ’s mercy by the rigours of the Law: for tlze Law is
our schoolmaster to bring us to Clzrz‘st.

We must observe also, that the doctrine of the Law is
adapted in one way, to those who are faithful and truly pe-
nitent, and in another to the reprobate and rebellious. To
the godly it should be set forth only as a rule of holy life,
by walking in which they obey God3 but not that they‘
should justify themselves thereby: to the ungodly it must
be set forth not only for the direction of their lives, but to
strike terror into their minds, and shew them the justice of
their condemnation, unless they repent and flee to Christ
their Mediator.-Thus have we considered the twofold
duty of warnz'ng and teacleing. Now, in the second place,
let us see how far this office extends.

Every mam] The Apostle appears to me to reiterate
these words for three reasons :

1. To display his Apostolic authority, and the right of
which he is possessed, to warn and to teach not only the
Colossians themselves, but also those teachers who made it
their business to corrupt the purity of the Gospel doc-
trines.

2. To shew that every distinction between Jew and
Gentile was removed, and that the Gospel was open not to
one nation only, but to all. Wherefore he says, Rom. i.
