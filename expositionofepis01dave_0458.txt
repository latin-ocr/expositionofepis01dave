372‘ AN EXPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL’S chaph.

they might say, You are far distant from us ; you are more-,
over ignorant of our affairs: you are not, therefore, soli-
citous about us3 neither if you would, can you recommend
those things which will conduce to the welfare of our
church. He removes each objection : the former by a dis-
tinction, I am distant from you, but in body, not in mind
and affection: the other by a negative, I am not ignorant of
your affairs, for Iperceive your order and saith: Ι am able
to advise you therefore, equally as if I were present-

But that we may proceed in order, it will be. proper to
observe, in the illustration of the words, two things: 1.
After what manner he is influenced, or the mode of the

that thought and remembrance of them, but of some ex-
traordinary presence of the Spirit granted to the Apostle
by Divine power: such as Elisha had, who perceived in
his mind those things which were done by his servant,
equally as though he had stood before him; which is ga-
thered from those words of the prophet, ‘2 Kings v. 26,
{Veni not mine hear-t with thee, when the man turned again
from his clmriot to meet thee? The prophet remained in his
