its former nature: but when the person of the Son of God
is incarnate and made man, that is not understood to be
done by transmutation‚ but (if it may be permitted to frame
a word‘) by a new personation of human nature. And thus
the Word was made flesh substantially, not by conjunctiora,
yet without a change of his nature3 by creating and unit-
ing the human nature to himself, not by changing the Di-
vine nature.

With respect to the human nature, it is objected,

1. If the human nature of Christ subsists in the person
of the Lam, not in its own proper personality, then the
man Christ will be more imperfect than all other men: be-
cause all others have human personality‚ and are subjeets
existing in that nature; Christ alone, in as far as he is*
man, hath not this personality, but subsists in the Divine
person of the Logos by the hypostatic union.

I answer3 Proper personality is not wanting to the hu-
man nature, on account of the defect of any thing which
is required to its perfection‚ hut on account of the addition
of something which far excels its nature, viz. its union to
a Divine person. Christ, therefore, is not more imperfect,
but more eminent than other men ; because our human na-
ture subsists in us in its proper personality, but it subsists
in Christ in that which is Divineg and it is much more
noble and honourable to subsist in God by hypostatic union
than to subsist by itself. For if we say the sensitive part
is more noble in man than in a brute, because it is joined
to a more nobleform, although in a brute theform is com-
plete, and in man it is not, but is joined to what is com-
plete: then, by parity of reason, the human nature is more
worthy and more excellent in Christ, on account of its
union with the Divinity‚ than in us, although in us it sub-
sists in proper personality‚ in Christ otherwise.

2. Itis objected, If the human nature of Christ sub-
sists in the person of the Logos, then he hath two perso-
nalities: for since a person is an z'ndevz'dual substance os a ra-
tional nature (according to the definition of Boethius) and
Christ, in as far as he is man, is a single rational being3 it
