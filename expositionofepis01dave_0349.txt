Ver.23. EpisTLE 'ro 'run conossmNS. 263

Gospel inspires the hope of salvation in us, through the
mercy of God alone, on the condition of fuith3 He that
believelh hath eternal life.

Therefore the Papists, who find the hope of their salva-
tion in the law, and trust to their own inerits f'orjustifica—
tion, overturn, and, as much as in them lies, extinguish
the grace of the Gospel. We do not exclude the pursuit
of good works‚ but the merit thereof3 neither do we deny
that those who are reconciled should do good works3 but
we maintain that these. works are not such, as can present
us holy and unreprovable before God: This is the peculiar
province of faith, as it apprehends Christ the Mediator and
Redeemer. Although, therefore, we have not a legal hope
which arises from the special merits and perfect observance
of the law3 yet we are not moved away from Evangelical
hope, which is founded on the gratuitous promises of God,
and his fatherly compassion by Christ.

Lastly, fron] all these considerations we conclude, that
there are two sorts of men altogether excluded from the
benefits of Christ: one, of those who are wholly devoid
of saith, of whom it is said, He that believelh not shall be
damned: the other, of those who have acquired a certain
appearance or shadow of saith, yet prove, by falling away,
that it was either a loose opinion, or a certain sudden
light3 not a true and justifying saith, rooted in the recess
of the heart, united with sanctification and regeneration.
Tertullian, De praescript. advers. haeret. cap. 3, says con-
cerning these, [et the straws os light faithfly away as they
will at any blast of temptation; the heap (ff corn will be laid
up lhe parer in lhe garner of God. And a little before, They
are neither to be regarded os prudent orsailhful whom heresies
have been able 1⁴0 draw aside. lle is no Christian unless heper-
severe even unco {he end„ Since, therefore, the utz'sz'ty and the
‘necessity os true and abiding faith is so great, the Apostle,
by this consideration, exhorts the Colossiam, and all Chris-
tians, to continue in the saith and the doctrine of the Gos-
pel.———Tl]us much as to the first reason.
