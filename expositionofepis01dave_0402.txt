treasure of the riches of salvation to men3 by what means
they have in Christ their hope of glory3 namely, as far as
he dwells z'n them, so far they have the hope of glory. But
Christ is said to be, or to dwell in any man, when he, by the
Holy Spirit exciting saith in the heart, attains to a true
knowledge of him, and a living trust flowing from that
knowledge. He, therefore, who truly believes all the doe-
trines concerning the natures, and the union of the natm-es,
and the peculiar offices of Christ3 his being, for instance,
very God and very man, the Mediator and Redeemer of the
human race, and the other points which are revealed in
the Word3 who, by the inspiration of the same Spirit, is
fully persuaded that Christ is so to him as he is in himself,
i. e. his God, his Mediator, Redeemer and Saviour3 the
man, I say, who implicitly believes these things, dwells in
Christ, and Christ in him, and by the operation of his
Spirit and of saith, receives all the riches of Christ. Upon
this ground, Christ himself plainly declares, in John xv.
that when separated from him we are dead as to spiritual
life; I am tlze Vz'ne, [με are tlze branc-hes.- lze that abidetlz ἶφι
me and l z’n him, the same bringetlz fortli muesz fruit. He
that ahz‘detlz ποτ in me, is castfortlz as α ὂναηεΙι, and is wither-
ed. But now, we abide in Christ when bound to him by
saith and the Spirit. Now the uses of this are these3

1. Since so long as Christ is not in us we cannot be
partakers of his spiritual blessings3 let us labour, by faith
in him, to induce him to take up his abode with us: for, as
Cyprian truly says, It z’s byfaitlz, and not by persomel con-
tact, we are united to Christ in this lzjie.

2. Since we can have no hope of obtaining glory, either
in ourselves‚ or in angels‚ or saints, or any where out of
Christ alone 3 much less let us look for it in our own works.

calls “ Testamentum Peregrini,’' part. 23
