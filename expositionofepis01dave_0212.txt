126 ΑΝ EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

the similitude of a traveller, who does not actually, every
step he goes, think of that place whither he is going, and
yet proceeds straight thither, by virtue of his primary in·-
tention.

But here we should be admonished of two things: First,
that we must endeavour, as much as possible, to retain the
actual intention of pleasing and of glorifying God in each
particular work. Secondly, we must take care, lest, after
the first good intention, some bad and inordinate intention
insinuate itself: for this latter does not derive rectitude
from the former3 but the former will by this latter be
marred, corrupted, and defiled.

2. Itis asked, Whether it be possible for a regenerated
man always to retain this habitual intention of pleasing God
in all things, although in the mean time he fails in many?

I answer3 That not only is it possible, but necessary, if
he wishes to retain faith and a good conscience: for these
cannot consist‚ neither remain in the same heart with the
design of sinning and of displeasing God. Therefore every
believer constantly keeps in mind the purpose of pleasing
God and of abstaining from sin, according to that saying
of Paul, The good that [would I do 7zot; but the evil which I
would not, that Ido. Now {j I do that Iwouldnot, it is no
more I that do it, but sin that clwelleth in me, Rom. vii. 19.
He who chooseth good, and not evil, retains the design of
pleasing God, although, being allured by evil concupis-
cence, he sometimes does that through infirmity which
displeases God, he makes it his main business to please
in all things, whilst he studies to avoid every single sin.

Lastly, it is asked, Whether a believer retaining this de-
sign of pleasing God, is always acceptable and pleasing to
him, notwithstanding those his failures and infirmities‘?

I answer, first, That the person of a godly and faithful
man is always pleasing and acceptable to God, because he
is regarded by God not as he is in himself, but as a mem-
ber under Christ the head3 But there is no condemnation to
them who are in Christ Jesus, Rom. viii. l. Secondly, The
good works of the faithful, although imperfect, are never·-
theless pleasing to God, because they are regarded by him
