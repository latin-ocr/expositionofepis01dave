78 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL’s Chap. i.

love, because from hence we understand you to be of the
number of those for whom an eternal reward is laid up in
heaven. So Athanasius.

Others refer these words to the verse immediately pre-
ceding in this sense3 We give thanks to God having heard
of your faith and love, which saith and love ye have em-

in heaven, i.e. on account of celestial blessedness. For
hope here is put for the things hoped for, as faith is often

First‚ that from hence we may understand that this re-

Apostle in writing to the Romans viii. 25, says, Ifwe hope
sor that we see not, then do we witlz patience waitjbr it. A
patient expectation is the proper effect of hope, and there-
fore very necessary3 because whatever is hoped for, is de-
ferred: and delay by its very nature is distressing, unless
patience attend us to sustain the mind. And this is the
language of patience, which Tertullian expresses in his
