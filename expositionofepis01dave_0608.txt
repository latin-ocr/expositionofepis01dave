522 AN EXl‘oSI'rloN or s·r. l‘AlJL’S Clmp. ii.

progress of the false apostles in their ordinarie-es is, there-
fore, described by this gradation. For as soon as they
had ensnared the consciences of men, they always pro-
ceeded to more rigid things. First, they forbad them to
eat of certain meats3 then, if they succeed in this, they
forbid them even to taste3 and, if here you resist them not,
then, lastly, they will enjoin you not even to touch.

And the Apostle rather insists upon these ordinances of
the difference of meats, thau upon others, because in this
point has the superstition of misemployed men exerted
itself: always in this abstinence from particular nieats
have they imagined that some sanctity consists. This may
even be inferred from the Apostle attacking it in so many
places3 The kingdom of (jod is nol meac and clrinlc, buc righ-
teonsness, and peace, and joy in tlte Holy Ghost, Rom. xiv.
17. Meat commendeslz us vot to God;forneill1er if we eat
are we tlte better ; neither, ij we eat not, are we the worse, l
Cor. viii. 8. In the latter limes5 some shall depart from tlte
juill& commande'ng to abstaz'n from meals, l Tim. iv. l, 3.
Unless this error had taken deep roots in the minds ofmen,
the Apostle would not have been compelled so frequently
to strive at eradicating it.

But here it may be asked‚ what difference ᾗς there be-
tween this imposture, and that which he had reproved
above at verse the 16th? for in each place, they who
wished a difference of meats to be observed by Christians
are reproved.

Ι answer‚ The former urged a choice of meats by virtue
of the Divine command and the law of Moses, which they
supposed not yet abrogated: but these latter employed
another pretence, as will be evident when we arrive at the
last verse. Both, then, urged the. same thing3 both would
ensnare the consciences of men3 both sought holiness and
righteousness in these ext-ernal rites: but the former would
have this abstinence from certain meats to be a thing corn-
manded by God3 the latter, to be a voluntary worship, and
therefore of greater merit with God. That the Apostle,
then, might the betterexpose their folly, he employs irony ς
