Ver. 13. EPISTLE To THE conossrANs. 153

lotos the wicked, which is enveloped in darkness and
deep gloom.

Verses 13, 14.
leo Izatlz delivered us from the power of darkness, ancl
lzatlz. translated us into the kingdom (ys his deor Son .-
In whom zoe have redemptz'on through lzz's blood, even tlte
forgiveness of sins.

The Apostle has been hitherto employed in enumerating
and enlarging upon those saving benefits which have been
bestowed upon us by God the Father: for the benefits of
our redemption are so united, that he who is a partaker of
one is a partaker of all. leo Izatlz made us meet to be por-
talcers [ff tlze inheritance <ff tlte saints z'n light, is the verse
preceding. Now, in verse 13, the Apostle connects two
other benefits‚ without which that preceding one cannot
stand3 and these are, deliverance from tlze power ῳ( dark-
ness, and translation into the kingdom (ff lzz's clear Son.

Who lzatlz delivered us from tlze power of darkness] In
explaining this benefit, three things are to be shewn by us:
1. leo hath delivered ς 2. PVlzom, or what sort of persons ;
3. From zolzat.

1. Who? Gocl tlze Father; for these words are imme-
diately connected with the foregoing‚ Gz'vz‘ng thanlcs to God
the Fatlzer, who lzatlz made us meet— Who also hatlz delivered,
or llatlzforcibly pluclcecl us αῑιῑπιψέἐ But the Father being
spoken of, we ought to understand the whole Trinity in
these external operations3 as we have before observed.
Wherefore the original author of man's deliverance is the
Triune and One God, who purposed this from eternity, and
in the fulness of time sent his Son to accomplish this
work which he had decreed. So God lovecl tlze world, &c.

³· ’Eppvw-ro, eripuit. ‘⁶ Not simply liberavit, sed eripuit. The word
signifies by main force to deliver, or pluck away, even as David pulled the
lamb out of the bear's 1110uth.”.-Vide Leigh's Critica Sacra.
