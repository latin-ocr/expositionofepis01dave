could the Colossians subject themselves either to the Mo-
saic ceremonies, or the maxims of philosophers, because
they had received Christ the Lord. From what we have
said we may deduce the following instructions:

l. The true saith is not to be changed, although the
prelates and doctors of the Church should begin to strike
out anew one; because as we have received, so we must
persevere. The Romanists, therefore, in vain thrust upon
us their novel opinions; it is sufficient to answer, We have

ᾗ 2. We must not persevere in every doctrine received

(md the lffe. Chrysostom hath made this observation, who
immediately adds, We must walle in Christ, because He is the
way, and not angels, which leads to our heavenly Father.

To walle in Christ denotes two things ε to persevere and to
advance in the doctrine and the faith of Christ3 to live
according to this rule and the guidance of the spirit of
Christ. As to the first3 saith hath a progressive motion ε
