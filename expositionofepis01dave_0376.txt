290 ΛΝ EXPOSI‘HON oF ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

others3 for Paul expressly says, that he wasfilling up that
which remained of the suffering-s of Christ, for la‘s body’s sake
which z's the Charch. And the Rhemish doctors infer from
it that the penal works of one member do make satisfaction
for others.

I answer, Paul's real meaning we have already explained,
viz. that he bore his many afflictions for the Church‚ not to
expiate sins, but for its edification and confirmation in the
doctrine of the Gospel. When, therefore, they argue that
from the circumstance of Paul having suffered many afflic-
tions for the Church, he did so to make satisfaction to
God for the Church, their argument is absurd ; for we have
assigned other causes for it. But we will confirm this
our interpretation by the testimony of Anselm, and then
conclude. Ι fill up, says he, those things which are want-
ing. But to whom (or where) are they wanting? In MY
body. For in the body of Christ, to which the Virgin gave
birth, no saffering was wanting ,· but in my body a part (ff his
szgfferings yet remain, which I endare daz‘ly κη behalf (ff his
universal body, which is the Church. For if Ι ceased to teach
thejaz‘thfal, I should not sastain these snfferings from those who
are without faith: bat inasnzach as I am always endeavourz'ng
to benqfit the Chnrch, I am alwaysforced to enclare afflictiores.
Such is Anselm's interpretatiom* From which it appears

¹· Anselm3 Archbisbop of Canterbury in the eleventh century, who,
though distinguished for his anxiety to uphold the power of the 'Roman
Pontiff, deserves to be remembered as a learned and devotional writer, and
as one of the principal revivers of literature after the prevalence of pro-
found ignorance for three centuries. He was a native of Piedinont, first
Prior and then Abbot of Bec, in Normandy. Invited over to England by
Hugh, Earl of Chester, he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1092,
but soon manifested his high Church predilections by refusing to consecrate
bishops invested by the king, ‹lenying it to be the king's prerogative. His
obstinacy on this and many such points, has laid his memory under much
obloquy; as he was thereby engaged in perpetual broils withWilliam Rufus
and Henry 11. respecting the affairs of the Church ς and much of his time
was spent in travelling backwards and forwards between England and Rome,
to obtain the advice and direction of the, Pope. He died in 1109, aged 76.
His works, with all his faults, bear certain testimony that his piety was sin-
cere and fervent.
