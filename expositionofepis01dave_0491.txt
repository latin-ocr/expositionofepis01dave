Ver. 8. ErisTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 405

But it is objected, that the Apostles after the passion of
Christ observed, and directed to be observed, some legal
institutions. Paul circumcised Timothy, Acts xvi. 3. By
>the de‘cree of the Apostles it was ordained that the Gen-
tiles should abstain from blood, and from things strangled,
Acts xv. 29, and this abstinence related to the observance
of a ceremonial law. By what right, therefore, are they
who lay upon Christians tlze rudiments (ff the world, i. e. the
ceremonial law, accounted as impostors?

We have one sufficient answer to both objections. As
to what pertains to the observance of ceremonies, it is
proper to distinguish with Augustine, Epist. 19, ad Hieron.
three periods. One was before the passionv of Christ, in
which the legal ceremonies were alive .· the other, after his·
passion, hut before the full developement of the Gospel, in
which they were dead: the third, after that the truth of the.
Gospel shone clearly, in which they were dead and buried.
We say, therefore, that Paul circumcised Timothy‚ and the
Apostles put forth that decree in the intermediate time in
which the legal institutions were not bm'ied. But it is meet
to add two other points: First, that the Apostles in this
intermediate time observed and retained these legal cere-
monies‚ not, however, as parts of the Divine worship, not
as figures of spiritual things3 (for as to faith and con-
science, they were abrogated by the passion of Christ) but
only ina manner for public utility, and for the sake of
avoiding offence‚ they observed those, as any other cere-
monies whatever, left at the discretion of the godly. For
so we see Tinlothy was circumcised by Paul, because he
thought it of advantage to the Church 3 Titus was not cir-
-cumcised, because he judged it not expedient. Timothy
received circumcision, therefore, not as a necessary Sacra-
ment (as Isaac, Jacob, and others had aforetime) but as an
indifferent ceremony. The same was the case with the
Apostolical decree about abstaining from blood and things
strangled3 which was not imposed upon Christians as a
certain matter established by the Divine law, but as suited
to those times, namely‚ that the Jewish and Gentile
