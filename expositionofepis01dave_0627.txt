errors to which they, who are wont either to order or to
practise these things, are commonly obnoxious.

1. They err as to the very nature of Christian mortifi-
cation : for they consider the afflicting and injuring of the
body to be true mortification 3 whereas, that pertains chiefly
not to the flesh, or the inferior part of the soul, but chiefly
to the mind and will: for the mind and will of a man not
yet renewed are carnal. They foolishly dream, therefore,
that they are mortified persons, through the body being
weakened and almost destroyed, when, in the meanwhile,
the soul, which is the seat of sin, is filled withincredulity,
pride, envy, and other spiritual vices. See Mirandulanus,
De fide et ord. credendi 3 and in Exposit. orat. Dom.

2. They err as to the means themselves, or, at least, as‘
to the mode of applying these means. For it is one thing
to subdue the flesh by moderate fasts and watchings, lest
it should rebel against the spirit; another, so to afflict and
wear down the natural powers, that they cannot advanta-
geously serve the spirit. For whilst tlzefleslz is undnly re-
slraz'ned‚ z't is enervated for the exercise of good worlcs: and
whilst they endeavour to stffle entirely tlte incentives to vice, it

cap, 28. Whence Aquinas, in xii. ad Rom. writes, that he
loses the dz'gnily of'a rational man, wlzo prefers fasting or
watclzing, to llzefnll use of lzz's senses. And Gerson, part. 3,
remarks, There lzave been many who, to merit tlee fame <ff
contemplation, lmve endeavoured to imitate Elias, or Daniel,
or John tlte Baptist ; bat who, by tlzis abstinence, lzave become,
not propliets, butfanatics.

3. They err, because they bind themselves to these
external services by the notion of a necessity so absolute,
as not to allow the violation-of them even for the sake of
health. We see this in the example of Paulas* we see it

³* This person, before alluded to, was a learned Roman Lady‚ of a noble
family, who added to the brightest qualities of the mind, the virtues of
Christianity. But superstition corrupts the fairest things; and under its
influence, this Lady‚ with others of her time, became famous in Papal his-
tory, by countenancing and promoting the monastic life. She was well

versed in the Hebrew Scriptures‚ and the intimate friend of Jerome, dying
a few years before him, A.D. 407.
