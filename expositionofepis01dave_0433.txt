Ve1⁴.2. EPISTLE To THE cotossxANs. 347

commentar-ies and decrees of men with divinely delivered
doctrine. For as water mixes not with fire, but fire is ex-
tinguished when water is poured upon it3 so the doctrines
of men cannot coalesce with the saving word of God3 but
when these are tacked to it, the fervour of the word (i. e.
the spiritual efficacy in gladdening the heart) is quenched.
Hence the Apostle says to the Galatians, v. 4, in opposi-
tion to the teachers of the law, who taught that the works
of the law were to be joined to saith in Christ for justifica-
tion, Christ is become of no effect unio you, wlzosoever of you
arejztstffied by the law.

The Papists snatch from men's hearts every comfort of
the Gospel, whilst they tread in the footsteps of these se-
ducers, and mingle with the doctrine of the Gospel their
own doctrine of indulgence& expiatory masses, and meri-
torious works3 in which they place the hope of obtaining
remission of sins, justification, and glorification3 while
the grace of Christ is neglected, or retained for form's
sake only. Itis, however, worthy of remark, that although
many, whilst idly disputing, thrust their masses, indul-
gences, merits, and such like things on God and man3 yet,
when their consciences contend in earnest with Divine jus·
tice, they are constrained to fly to Christ alone, and in
very deed confess, that their hearts cannot be comforted, if
this doctrine be departed from. Of this we will adduce
some testimonies ε

(Ience in the deatlz of Christ alone ,· commit tloeyself wholly to
this deatlm with this death cover thyself; and involve tleysels
entirely in him. If the Lorcl would judge thee, say, Lord, I
place the death of my Jesus between me and thee aud thyjudg-
πωπω otl1e2wise I conlend not with thee. I bring fot-ward his
merit for my merit, whz'ch‘I ought to hove; but, alas! have
not. Parisiensis‚ in Lib. de Rhetor. divina, says, Ye must be-
ware, in contending with God, lest you rely on α frail founda-
tion ; which he does ‘coho cmgfides in his own merits. For as Ιιε
who strives οη his own merits, deprives himself (ff the aid of
God ; so he who altogether distrusts himself, and relies on grace
alone, attrctccs lo himself che aid of God. Gerson, in his
