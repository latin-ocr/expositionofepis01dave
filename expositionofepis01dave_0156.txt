70 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

By saints the Apostle understands the baptised‚ and
those who profess the Christian religion, as we have before
shewn ξ* for love presumes such to be true saints.

As to the object of love we must know, that the saints
are neither its only nor primary object. For, as Augustine
writes, De doctrin, Christ. i. 25, There are four oly'ects of
our love,- one, that which is above us, viz. God ; another, that
which is ourselves ; the third, that which is near to us, viz. our
neighhom· ; the fourth, that which is beneath us, viz. our own
body. Concerning each of these we shall speak somewhat
briefly.

1, First‚ then, the principal, and also the formal object
of love, is God himself: for he is loved for himself, all
other things in their relation to him, and as far as they
participate, or are able to participate the Divine likeness
and blessedness. When, therefore, the Apostle celebrates
the love of the Colossians to the saints, he does not ex-
clude, but necessarily supposes love to God. For as a co-
lour is not seen without light. because light is the medium
of seeing colour: so our neighbour is not loved without
the love of God, because God is the medium of our loving
our neighbour. Hence the Saviour in those two great com-
manus places foremost the love of God, as the cause and
fountain of the love of our neighbour. Matth. xxii. 37—-
39. Hence also Augustum, Confess. lib. lO, cap. 29, ob-
serves, He loves {hee less than is right, who together with thee
loves any thing else for any other cause than because he loves
thee.

2. Augustine places oneself as the second object of
love to every one, and that rightly. For as the Philoso-
pher (Aristotle) has observed‚ Eth. ix. cap. 8, Ἀπ’ ἀυτου
mista τοι φιλικοὶ καὶ πρὸς τούς *amous διηκειε All lciudly feelings
proceed from orzeselj' towards others. And God himself in
the command of loving our neighbour includes the love of
oneself3 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Plain
reason also evinces this. For since love is founded upon
the communication of the divine fruition or blessedness,
