8 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAUL’s Chap. i.

who is always reminding himself, Iam a Bishop, I am a
Presbyter, must needs at the same time understand, that it
s not allowable for him to indulge in idleness, or natural in-
clination, but that he must keep his eye on his flock. It
is scandalous to be compelled to say of ministers what
Tacitus (Hist. 3) writes of Licinius, Such α torpor had in-
vaded lzis mind, that unless others reminded ln'm that lze was a
prince, he himself would haveforgotten it.

3. That it is incumbent upon those appointed to eccle-
siastical dignity, not only to discharge the duties of their
office, but to defend the authority and respectability of that
office against obstinate and schismatical revilers. For so
Paul claims to himself apostolic dignity not from sels-con-
sequence, but lest the contempt of his authority should
bring into contempt that of the Church: for contempt of
religion itself always follows contempt of those who are at
the head of the church and direct the affairs of religion.*
Hence Paul advised Timothy so to conduct himself, as that
no one should despise his youth, 1 Tim. iv. 12.

It would be easy to deduce from these instructions many
things adapted to form and correct the manners3 but that
may be left to your own industry and prudence.† I shall
add two things only, which, from the declaration that Paul
was made an Apostle by the will (ff God, conduce greatly to
the comfort of the godly. It hence appears, .

l. That God cannot but prove efficient when those
means are used for the salvation of men which he himself
hath ordained for that purpose. Although, therefore, the
preaching of the Gospel by men weak, despised, defiled
by sin, may seem an insignificant means to the attainment
of human salvation 3 yet, since it is the ordinance and will of
God, it will prove most effectual ε for thefoolislmess of God
is wiser than men, and the wealcness of God is stronger than
man, 1 Cor. i. 25. There will be no need therefore to ex-

* Here we are reminded of the well known opinion of Dr. Johnson, that
“ Malevolence to the Clergy is not far removed from irreverence for Reli-
gion.'' The coincidence of sentiment is singular.

† It should be borne in mind that this Exposition was delivered as Lec-
tures to Divinity Students in the University.
