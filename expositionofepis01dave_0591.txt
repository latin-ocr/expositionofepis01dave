Ver. 18. urisTLE To ‘riis COL0551ANS. 505

i. e. worship inferior to that which is Divine. But this je-
suitical tergiversation avails nothing. For the Apostle for-
bids not this or that, but all worshipping of angels, i. e. all
religious worship not founded in the word of God, whether
that used by the followers of Magus, or the Papists. It
is, then, ridiculously said, That he forbids that religious
worship which Simon Magus paid to angels, therefore, not
that which the Papists render: for he forbad both. More-
over the Platonists themselves, or the heretics did not
worship the angels as in their apprehension first causes,
but as ministers under God ; they, therefore, might use
that distinction of latria and dulia, as well as our Papists.
Lastly, the Fathers in this place testify that the same wor-
ship is forbidden which the Papists daily render, viz. the
worship of invocation, whereby they acknowledged the
angels as Mediators between God and man. For so Theo-
doret and Chrysostom assert3 the former of whom declares
that oratories were built to the angel Michael by those
idolatrous worshippers of angels3 which every one knows
is also done by the PapistS.

But since the Papists‚ whatever worship they pay to
angels or saints, always escape through this loop-hole‚ viz.
That they do not render it with the intent of worshipping
them with latria, as the first cause and authors of good,
but with dulia, as servants most pleasing to God, by whose
assistance they more easily obtain whatever they require
from God, the fountain of all good 3—we shall clearly shew,
that they do render that to angels and saints, which pertains
to that highest worship of latria. Laying aside, therefore,
all that tacit mind and intention of theirs‚ which God alone
knows, we shall deliver ourjudgment upon this point from
the external actions, which meet our eyes and ears.

l. Prayer, or religious invocation, is an act of latria, or
of the highest worship: for when we pray religiously, we
acknowledge that he upon whom we call can hear us, that
he can deliver us, that he can give us those good things
which we ask3 Whence that declaration in the Psalms,
Psal. l. 15, Call upon me z'n the day qs trouble; I will deliver
