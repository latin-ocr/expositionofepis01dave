XX LIFE OF EISIIOP DAVENANT.

daeious corruptions (abundant as they are) which literary history
presents; but should complain of the ‘⁴ querulousness oer. Scott''
on a subject which ought to excite the indignation of every honest
man, especially the advocate of one who was himself the victim

of calumny and injustice.
On the other hand, it ought not to be concealed, that the ac-

count of the Synod of Dort published by Mr. Scott, is a mere trans-
lation of the Synod's own narrative of its procecdings; and their
whole conduct entitles them to little respect when stating their
own cause, even were it less evident that trull] is not very strictly
adhered to. The venerable Editor was probably not deeply ac-
quainted with the history of the Council, nor well versed in the
volumes of Carleton, Hales, and others, who were present 3 or in
the detailed, though, perhaps, somewhat prejudiced‚ account of
Brandt. Yet, agoeeing, as he undoubtedly did, in the main, with
the Canons of the Synod, and receiving their statement with a
partial eye, his concluding observations are characteristic of the·
piety and good sense of that admirable man. Speaking of the
persecuting conduct of other churches, he finally remarks, “The
proceedings of the Synod of Dort, and of the rulers of Belgium

but observe how little equity, not to say sacred truth, has been
regarded in their proceedings3 how few proofs appear of the pre-
sence of the Holy Spirit in such assemblies3 and how difficult it
is for a candid mind to avoid approving the conclusion of an an-
tient father of the Church, “ I never saw any yood in Ecclesias-
tical Councz'ls, and am well nigh inclined to attend no more.''

To compress the whole of our Author’s concerns with the Synod
together, wc have to notice an attaek made upon him and his
Colleagues some time after, for their conduct; himself being then
in the See of Sarum, Carleton in that of Chichester, and Balcan·
qual in the Deanery of Rochester. It is well known that King
James, in the decline of life, became much changed in his theo-
logical views; inclining towards Romanism, which he had once so
stoutly opposed, and, of course, declining from the tenets of
Dort, which he had once as stoutly advocated. Among the rising
divines of that period, was Dr. Richard Montague, a very learned
and able theologum, but as zealous against Puritanism as Laud
