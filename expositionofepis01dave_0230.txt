144 AN Exposvron oF ετ. PAUL’s Chap. i.

Now we will follow the thread of the contextjand be-
gin from this 12ῐί1 verse, in which three things are to be
observed ε

l. The primary cause of salvation‚ or of our redemp-
tion‚ the mercy of G0d;

2. The primary effect of this mercy, ἱκανότης, a certain
new and supernatural faculty and fitness in us ;

ἢ

0. The end of this new faculty or meetness, that we
may participate in the heavenly inheritance.

Givz'ng thanks to the Fatlzer] These words are connected
with the 9th verse, where the Apostle sayS‚ We cease not to
pray for you, and to desire that με might be filled witlz all
knowledge, διας now he subjoins, Giving thanlcs to the
Father who hatlz made us meet. This third part of the chap-
ter, which relates to the benefit of redemption, the Apostle
beautifully and wisely opens by the giving· of thanks : By
which conduct of his he would intimate to us these two
things3

l. That this benefit of human redemption is so great
that it would be impious not only to discourse, but even
to think of without the utmost gratitude of soul. Scarcely
ever does the Apostle mention this, but forthwith he breaks
out into praising and blessing God. Ephes. i. 3, Blessed he

critic of our own time (Rosenmi'iller), has remarked, “ that although Cal-
vin was not deeply versed in Hebrew, yet, as he possessed an acute and
subtle genius, his interpretations of Isaiah in particular, contain many
things which are exceedingly useful for understanding the Prophet's mean-
ing.'' Nothing, indeed, can more satisfactorily evince the high estimation
to which the Commentaries of Calvin are still entitled from the Biblical
Student, than the following eulogium of one of the most learned Prelates
that ever adorned the Anglican Church—Bishop Horsley. ‘4 1 hold,’' says
he, “ the memory of Calvin in high veneration 3 his works have a place in
my library3 and in the study of the Holy Scriptures, he is one of the Com-
mentators whom I most frequently consult.'’ To this testimony may be
added that of another accomplished Scholar lately deceased, the Rev. J. J.
Conybeare. “ The Commentaries of Calvin,” he observes, in his Bamp'·
ton Lectures for 1824, p. 237, “ though in the exercise of our Christian
liberty we may freely question and dissent from many points, both of doc-
trine and discipline, maintained by their illustrious author, are yet never
to be perused without admiration or instruetion.'’
