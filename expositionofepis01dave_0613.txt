and the useful end to which these observations are re-
ferred.

Thlus much concerning the former reason, derived from
the nature and condition of the things themselves.

After the commandmenls and doctrines ofmen] This is
that other reason why the religion, righteousness‚ or salva-
tion of Christians is not placed in those deci-ees, Tonch not,
toste not, handle not, and such trifles3 viz. because they
derive not their origin from God, but from men. For al-
though God himself imposed upon the Jews, under the old
Testament, ceremonial ordinances of this kind, that they
might possess in them shadows of spiritual and future
things3 yet, under the GospeL he commanded the same to
be abrogated. so that now they are imposecl by the com-
mandments of rnen, not by the authority of God. lt is,
therefore, rightly said, that all those things are now after
lhe commandamus and doctrines of men.

But let us weigh the force of this argument; This is
after the commandments and doctrines of men: therefore,
it is not one of the things necessary to salvation, or to the
worship of God, or for the acquiring of sigliteousness and
holiness 3 for the following reasons:

1. Because God retains to himself alone this honour of
appointing what he will have directly and immediately to
pertain to Religion and his worship. ἴε shall noc do every
man whatsoever is right in his own eyes: but what thing soever
shall be commanded yon os the Lord, observe to do it,- thou
shall not add mereto, nor dinzinishfi‘om il ; Deut. xii. 8, 32.
Hence that remark of Christ, Matth. xv. 9, In vain με
worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandments (ff men.

2. Because if these commandments of men pertained to
the worship of God as parts of it, it would follow that the
worship of God might be abrogated by human authority ε
for all these decrees may be either taken away or changed
by the authority of those by whom they were ordained from
the beginning: but that men have this power over the wor-
ship of God is most absurd.

3. Because if it be conceded that the observance of
human decrees is a necessary part of worship or holiness
