persons, therefore, are reproved, who, seizing every occa—
sion, flee away from Christ to Antichrist: but, as Chrysos-
tom says, that which is grounded and rooted, is not easily
moved away. They also are censured who cleave to Christ
only externally, when they have their roots in the mean

their own trumpery among the people‚ take special care
that the word of God should be withheld from them. But
let us proceed.

of saith ε Now, in the second place, he touches that abun-
dance, or sufficiency, which he requires in the faith of the
Colossians, or rather, that which he states to be in the
faith of Christ alone. This abundance interpreters refer to
that perpetual increase which is required from believers in
matters of saith. Therefore, they think that the Apostle
exhorted them, that they should not only not abate, but
daily grow in the abounding knowledge of evangelica! doc-
