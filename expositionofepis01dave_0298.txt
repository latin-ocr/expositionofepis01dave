Church from the foundation of the world? Things are
present to God and to saith, which are not present to na-
ture. Aquinas, quaest, disp. de gratia Christi, art. 4. ad.
9m. says, T hat Christ, according to his human nature, was the
head of the Church before his incarnation, by the operation of
saith, which apprehended his future incarnation ; and so acquir-
ed the benefic ofjustifi'cation. But that Divine of Altissio-
dorum speaks much more clearly, lib. 3. tract. i. quaest. 3.
de dignitate Christi capitis, &c- He asks‚ Whether Christ,
as to his human nature, was the head of Abel and of the rest of
the faithful ,· and whether they were members of the body of
Christ? He answers, that there was then the same saith re-
specting his fntme incarnation, as there now is concerning his
past incarnation ; and the same efficacis in their saith as in onrs.
As, therefore, saith in Christ who is now come, makes a man

But it is also further objected3 that Christ is not the
head of the Church in his Divine nature, inasmuch as ac-
cording to that he hath not a conformity of nature with
the rest of the members; nor yet according to his human
uature, because in respect of that he has not the power of
infusing spiritual life to his members: therefore in no way
is it the case.

We answer, first, generally3 If there be found in the
person of Christ the perfect quality of a head, this is suf-
ficient for his being in strict truth called the head, although
neither in one nature nor the other, separately considered,
all the conditions of headship may meet. To that which
was objected concerning the humanity not infusing life and
spiritual motion, we answer by a distinction. The life of
grace is infused either by the primary agent, who creates
grace in the soul in the way of its original source3 and in
this sense grace flows from the Deity alone; or by an in—
