fore, expound them, The beginning, the first-born from the
dead. Others supply the copulative καί, ΤΙιε beginning AND
the first-born from the dead: so Beza. Athanasius, and
after him Calvin, interpret them by supplying the causal
conjunction, lee beginning, BEcAUsE thefirst-bornsrom the
dead. Chrysostom reads, not ἀρχη, as it stands in our co-
pies, but ἁπειρχη, tlte first fruits and first-born, διο. But this
is of little importance to the main point. For according to
all, the Apostle signalizes Christ with these titles to shew
that he not only rose first, but that he is to his Church,
i. e. to all his members, the beginning and fountain of sal-
vation and of grace in this life; of glory and of blessed-
ness in that which is to come. For the Church hath a
twofold state: of grace and of a spiritual resurrection in
this life3 of glory and of a beatified resurrection in the
other: The Apostle‚ therefore, in this place, declares¹
Christ to be the author of both.

Two things, then, are here to be explained: l. That
Christ himself was the first in the glorious resurrection:
2. that Christ was the first in such manner as to be to all
of us the cause, as well of the spiritual resurrection, where·-
by we rise again from the death of sin, as of the corporeal
resurrection, whereby we rise to the life of glory. For
Christ was both the first in the order of rising as it re-
spects himself, and the beginning as it respects us.

As to the first point; Christ is rightly called the begin-

ning and tlze first-born from the dead ; for he alone hath risen
as the beginning of his resurrection, raising his body by
the power of his Godhead. He also alone hath risen to
spiritual life and glory, no more to die. That he rose by
his own power, not by that of another, is clear: John ii.
19, Destroy this temple, and in tlzree days I will raise it up.
1 have power to lay down my Ιῇε, and I have power to take it
again, John x. 18. Although, therefore, we read both in
the Old and in the New Testament, that some rose from the
dead before Christ, this does not strip Christ of these
titles3 forno one hath risen as the beginning of his resur-
rection, but all were quickened by the efficacy of another.
Besides, none of those arose to the immediate enjoyment
