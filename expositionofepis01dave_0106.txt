20 AN EXPOSITION OF s'r. PAUL’S Chap. i.

marked.

The persons saluted then have a threefold description3
First, from the place in which they live; 2. From three es-
pecial properties, holiness, fidelity, brotherhood; 3. From
the Author of all, viz. ChristJesus: for they are saints in
Christ, saitlfful in Christ, and brethren in Christ.

Concerning the Colossians we have spoken already in
the preface3 nor is it necessary to add more. This only

we shall observe by the way, that although the Catholic ·

may fall away from the true religion. This happened to
these Colossians3 and to all the churches which Paul ho-

which directs us to presulne good of every one, unless the

other eminent divines and writers of the same name, in the fourth and fifth
centuries. He was a distinguished disciple of Chrysostom, aMonk, and
