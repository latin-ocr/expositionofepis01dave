Ver. 6. EPISTLE 'ro 'rna cotossmns. 381

Whence we are said with propriety enough to walk, when
we proceed in the faith itself. They shall go from strength
to strength, says the Psalmist lxxxiv. 7. And Paul, Rom.
i. l7‚fromfaitlz tofaz‘tlz. But this term of walking is much
more often acconimodated to progress in a course of holi-
ness. Hence lo walle in the ways, or in tlte commandments (gf
God, is in frequent use by David3 and with Paul, to walk
after lhefleslz, or cffter the Spirit ; to walk in vewness qflgft,
or as children (ff light ; and in many like passages.

Therefore two things are required: that they should
abide and proceed in the faith; that they should conform
their life to the rule of faith. Now let us deduce some in-
ferences.

l. As Christians are rightly said to walle in Christ, be,-
cause they regulate both their saith and their life by the
rule prescribed by hin13 so the Monks walk in the respec-
tive founders of their sects, who seek perfection in the rule
invented by them.

2. Since Christ is the only way to heaven, he who aims
at heaven out of Christ, wanders about blind and miser-
able, and will never arrive thither.

3. He who thinks he can walk in Christ by a solitary
saith, attempts to walk with one foot, which is impossible.
To walle in Christ is to proceed as well in holiness as faith3
for the Spirit of Christ stirs up to both or neither.

4. The life of a Christian man is in constant motion.
He departs from sin and the world, and advances in holi-
ness of life, and towards the heavenly state, by Christ as
by the way, saith and love inclining him to this new mo·
tion as inherent qualities; but impelled and directed by
the Spirit of Christ as the principal agent and mover‚ who
also himself imparted both saith and love.

And thus we have briefly explained what the Apostle re-
quired to be done in this his hortatory conclusion3 namely,
that they would cleave to Christ; to which he draws them,
]. By proposing the rule itself to their contemplation3 2.
by requiring> their submission to this rule. Now it follows,
that we explain how we are to abide in Christ3 which we
learn from the following verse.
