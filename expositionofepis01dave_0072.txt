depressed below the degree of the apostleship‚ in being called
Disciples or Presbyters5 so when certain of the Disciples were
called Apostles, and certain of the Presbyters Biskops‚ they were
not directly equalled with the Apostles and Bishops properly so
called. Words siynffy according as they are understood, says
Durandus. Now, we understand, as well from Scripture, as from
the perpetual practice of the Church, that the term Bishop, taken
larger, may be accommodated to any one who has the care of
souls: but, taken strictly and appropriately, it suits those alone
who have the singular power of ordaining, and exercising the keys.
Therefore, from the promiscuous use of the termS, a parity of
ministers is not duly inferred.

3. They object, that although it be acknowledged that the
Apostles were superior to the other Ministers of the Gospel, yet,
as their vocation was extraordinary‚ so also was their power.
Bishops, therefore, cannot claim superiority or power over other
Presbyters, because this excelling power being annexed to the
persons of the Apostles, did not pass over to the Bishops their

successors.
We answer, that Jerome said rightly, Bislzops hold in the Ca-

tlzolic Church the place of the Apostles. Yet we allow that many
of their privileges were personah and cannot be claimed by
Bishops ε Such as were, immediate vocation, universal delegation
to all nations, infallibility in teaching‚ the gift of tongues and mi-
racles; in one word, whatever specially related to the laying the
first foundations of the Christian Church. But the Apostles had
certain privileges which distinguished them from ordinary Presby-
ters‚ and were plainly necessary for the enlargement of the
Church. Of this kind were ordination of presbyten—s, that the
Gospel Ministry might not utterly perish3 and the government of
Presbyters‚ that they might not destroy the Church by heresies,
schisms, or corrupt morals. These, and such as these, without
which a Church when constituted can neither well* exist, nor be
rightly governed, were transmitted to Bishops, and make them
higher in degree, and greater in power, than other Presbyters.

In the last place, they strongly object the authority of Jerome,
who says on Titus i. A Bislzop and Presbyter is one; and before
parties took place in reli9i0n‚ tlte Church was governed by the
common counsel of Presbyters. And he adds: Let Bishops know
that they are superior to Presbyters‚ more by custom, than any
true appointment of the Lord.
