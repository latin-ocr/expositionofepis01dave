requisite for all Christians‚ however humble their station,
ministers of the word, who, of course, are exposed to inju-
ries and reproaches of all kinds, and from every quarter,
have the more need of it. Christ himself has apprised
them of this in these words: Ye shall be hoteclcffall ‘mensor

Thus we see how the Apostle behaved in his afflictions:
Let us now investigate the causes of such exemplary pa-
