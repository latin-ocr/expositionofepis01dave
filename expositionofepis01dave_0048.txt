xxxviii ΜΠ, or BISHOP DAvENAN'r.

beginning 01' Lent last; the particulars of which you shall under-
stand by the enclosed parcel of a letter he wrote me. Ι am right
sorry the delivery of the established doctrines of our Church
should be thus questioned.'' The details of this whole affair are
given at length by Fuller and other writers. The Bishop was af-
terwards admitted to kiss the King's hand, but enjoined not to
offend in the same way again !

Davenant‚ however, was not the only prelate who was annoyed
by the Court at this time. Not to mention the long and bitter
persecution with which Laud for so many years barrassed Williams,
who had been his original benefactor, and which is detailed in all
its disgraceful features by Bishop Hacket; who can hear without
indignation‚ one of the most illustrious ornaments of the English
Church, Bishop Hall, complain, that he was brought three seve-
ral times on his knees before the Council, to answer false and idle
criminations3 and that he only escaped further worrying by

suhjects controverted between Romanists and Protestants, or be-
tween Protestants of different views. They are all handled with
great acuteness, learning, and moderatiori. To one of these,
Quaestio xi„ Archbishop Williams referred upon a memorable oc-
casion, a short time after Davenant's decease. A Bill having
been introduced to deprive Bishops of their scats in the house of
lords, it was so ably opposed by williams, as to lead to its' re·
jection for that time. In this masterly speech, he refers to our
Prelate as an authority entitled to veneration in that assembly.
‘² The civil power,'’ said he, in the course of his address, “ is a
Divine ordinance, set up to be a terror to the evil, aud an encou-
ragcment to good works. This is the whole compass of the civil

power. And therefore, I do here demand, with the most learned
Bishop Davenant, that within a few days did sit by my side, in
