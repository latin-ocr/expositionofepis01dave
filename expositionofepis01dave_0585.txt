Ver. 18. πρώτως To THE COLOSSIANS. 499

In this verse the Apostle does three things.

1. He deeply brands those seducers,and concludes that
no regard is to be paid to them3 and that on two accounts:
First, because they usurp the authority ofjudges to them-
selves3 secondly‚ because they abuse the same to defraud
the people. Both these are intimated in the words, Let ηο
man begaile you of your reward, accordihg to his will.

2. He shews in what instance they abused the authority
usurped, and endeavoured to deceive the people‚ viZ.
whilst they suggest to them a foolish humility‚ and the wor-
ship of angels3 in a voluntary humility and worshipping qf
angels.

3. He reproves this erroneous doctrine on a double
charge, viz. that of ignorance and pride. It arises from ig· ’
norance; for they intruded into those things which they had not
seem and from pride, for these things they prated about,
not being taught of the spirit, but relying upon their own
wit, vainly plff'd up by theirfleshly mind.

Lec ηο man beguz'le you of your reward] He rebukes
those seducers, and shews they were not to be accounted
of: 1. Because in sacred things which had respect to the
worship of God, and the salvation of men, they arrogate
to themselves, by no right whatever, an imperious power of
determining and decreeing, even as the judges were accus-
tomed in contests, For these voluntary umpires decreed
the reward of eternal life to be granted to no one who was
unwilling to subscribe to their novel doctrines. But whence
did they derive this authority of defining? Who made
them lords over the faith of Christians? Who gave them
the power of framing new doctrines? They truly usurped
to themselves this office, and became voluntary judges by
their own suffrages. Therefore, inasmuch as the Apostle
strikes at this usurped authority of seducers, we must un-
derstand that such power is granted to no mortal man, that
he should determine any thing in matters of saith and reli-
gion of his own will; but is bound to judge according to
the rule of law, i. e. according to the sacred Scriptures:
If they spealc not according to this word, ic z's because there is no

light in ehem, Isa. viii. 20. Ρναΐίη-ἑζΓ without tlte authorilyof
