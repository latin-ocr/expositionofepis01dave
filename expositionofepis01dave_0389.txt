Vas-26. EPISTLE To THE coLosSIANS. 303

Observe 1. The doctrine of the Gospel is a sacred mys-
tery; therefore it ought to be received with reverence and
purity both of heart and ears. The Gentiles drave all pro-
fane and impure persons from their sacred inysteries3 how
much more becoming is it that every kind of impurity
should be discarded from these saving mysteries? The
law commands all men, says Cicero, 2 De legibus, to ap-
proach the sacrifices with purity: But the Gospel is, indeed,
a sacred secret3 therefore, let both the preacher and all
his hearers approach it in purity both of mind and body.

2. The Gospel was a mystery concealed from all eter-
nity3 therefore it had existed from all eternity3 and, con-
sequently, is not a new invention of the Apostles, as the
Athenians called it when they took Paul to task for preach-

false is new. Wloerefore, in the Apocalypse, xiv. 6, it is
called the everlasting Gospel,

3. Since it pleased God that this saving Gospel should
be concealed from the whole world for so many ages, the
very novelty of its manifestation ought to stimulate us to
a serious contemplation of it3 for if otherjewels derivethez'r
valnefrom their raricy only, as Tertullian observes, surely
this jewel of the Gospel, which not a single being had a
clear view of during a period of almost four thousand yearS,
is much more valuable.

Thus far, then, as to the Gospel having been a hidden
mystery from all eternity: now let us discuss its revela-
tion and manifestation.

But now is made known to hz's saints] Three points may
here be remarked upon. l. Why this mystery was mani-
fested. 2. When. 3. To whom.

1. The Apostle says, that this mystery was manffested,
not discovered, 01· brought forth to the light by our labour3
to the end that we might understand that no human inge-
