34 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL’S Clcap. i.

ers appears evident, who attribute to externa] sacraments
a physical causation of grace.

Onr Fallimu] God, as God, as Creator, wills good to
all his creatures, but not all good. For he wills the com-
munication of the good things of nature not only to wick-
ed rnen, but to the very brutes; because he bestows them
as the Author of nature: but the good things of saving
grace he communicates to his children alone-3 because
these he dispenses as the Father of mercy. And for this
reason the Apostle added Our Fatlzer. On this account
the Saviour when he prescribed a form of prayer, taught
us to invoke Our Famem because there is no hope of oh-
taining the good things of grace unless we are adopted
among his children. And from this paternity of God he

Angelical Doctor;'' and his authority among the Schoolmen was almost de-
cisive in Theology. Like our own Hooker he was little less eminent for his
sels-denying humility, than for his wide erudition and deep reasoning pow-
ers. It is said that when Pope Clement IV. shewed him a vast heap of
wealth, observing, ί You see the Church cannot now say, Silver and gold
have I none ;' ⁶ True,' replied the great Schoolman, ⁶ neither can she now
say to the sick, Take up thy hed and walk.’-Though, like other fallible
men, and especially voluminous writers, he is sometimes found in error, yet
Protestant Divines and Scholars have donejustice to the vast attainments of
this wonderful man. Our Expositor frequently quotes him as authority in
points of importance. Dean Philpotts sayS‚ “ 1 do not affect to be deeply
versed in his writings; but I have read enough of them to bear testimony
to the uncommon vigour and astonishing acuteness of his mind.’‘ (Letters
to Chai-les Butler, Esq.) And Mr. Southey speaks of him, as ⁴³ a man
whose extraordinary powers of mind few persons are competent to appre-
ciate.” (Vindiciae Ecc. Aug.) As calculated in an especial manner to
stamp the character of the man, and as a hint to those who forget that,
Bene orasse est bene studuisse, it may not be improper to insert here,

The Prayer of Thomas Aquinas before commencing study :—

“ lneffably wise and merciful Creator! illustrious Source of all things !
true Fountain of light and wisdom ! Vouchsafe to infuse into my under-
standing some ray of Thy brightness: thereby removing that two-sold
darkness under which Ι was born, the darkness of sin and ignorance. Thou,
that makest the tongues of infants eloquent, instruct, Ι pray Thee, my
tongue likewise: and pour upon my lips the grace of Thy benediction.
Give me quickness to comprehend‚ and memory to retain: Give me a faci-
lity in expounding, an aptitude in learning, and a copious eloquence in
speaking. Prepare my entrance into knowledge3 direct me in my pursuits,
and render the issue of them complete ε through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.“
