340 AN EXPOSITloN OF ετ. PAUL's Cleap. ii.

19. Sometimes he mourned, grieved, and feared by be-
holding their dissensions, errors, or afflictions. leo is
qfflz'cted‚ and Iam not afflicted? &c. 2 Cor. xi. 29. Ifear,
lest as the serpent beguiled Eve, so, &c. 2 Cor. xi. 3. As to
what relates to actions, the mind of the Apostle was
scarcely ever free from conflict. He had continual con-
flicts of prayer against Satan, and· his satellites, for the
salvation of the faithful, Rom. xvi. 20. And 2 Thess. i.
ll, We pray alwaysfor you, διο. He moreover contended
by writing and preaching, with false apostles, detecting
and refuting their errors3 with all ungodlincss of men,
restraining, and dispersing it, as appears in 2 Cor. x. 4,
Sec. Lastly, he contended with the infirmities of the faith-
ful themselves, reproving, instructing, and consoling them ;
as is every where to be seen in the writings of Paul.
These were the conflicts of mind by which Paul was daily
distracted. But neither was the body of the Apostle free
from its own tortures : it had to encounter fatigues, watch-
ings, hunger, thirst, fasfflngs, inclemency of weather, and
racks, 2 Cor. xi. 23, &c. Whether, therefore, we regard
the labours he sustained‚ or the griefs he underwent, in
each respect the Apostle was distinguished by divers bo-

dily conflicts.
If now it be asked, What advantage could result from

this commemoration of so many of the Apostle's conflicts
of mind and body 2 It is answered, That the Apostle pro-
posed to himself no other end than the good of the
Church. For that he might bring men to Christ, present
them perfect in Christ, keep them stedfast and persevering
in the faith of Christ, and lead them at last to the king-
dom of Christ, he sustained the conflicts before-mentioned.
So he himself declares, 2 Tim. ii. 10, leerefore I endure all
tliingssor tlte elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salva-
tion wlzz‘ch is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. From these
things various arguments touching Ministers may be
gathered.
