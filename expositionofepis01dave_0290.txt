phere by participating in the influence of the sun: so God
has his existence from his own nature ; all other things by
participating in existence'from him. As, therefore, the
brilliancy of the atmosphere immediately ceases when the
bright shining of the sun ceases3 so the existence of every
creature instantly vanishes when God’s conservating power
is withdrawn.

2. In reference to God. the action is the same with the
preservation as the creation of his creatures3 the only dif-
ference between then] is, that creation exhibits the acting
power of God in the original production of a creature3
preservation shews the sume action in not deserting the
creature when produced. A creature has the beginning of
its existence from the energy of God ; the continuance of
its existence from the same God, not withholding that
energy. Durandus, therefore, has not hesitated to assert
of every creature, that, as long as it is in existence, so long it
is being created [41] God, because usfar as God is concerned, the
work qf creation and tlze preservation of cremares is llze same.
Hence it follows, that by whomsoever all things are forni-
ed, by the same also are they preserved3 forpreserration is
vot by a new act, but by llze continuante of that act which ori-
ginally gave existence. Durand. lib. ii. dist. l. quaest. ⁸2.

3. As every work of art presupposes a work of nature
for its foundation3 so every work of nature presupposes a
work of God: for as every artificer borrovvs his materials
from nature, so nature herself does from God. In‘the
same manner, therefore, as the existence of all works of
art is preserved by virtue of the natfiral substance of which
they are composed3 so the essence of natural substances
continues by virtue of the preservation of God,who created
them. ⁷

4. Every effect depends upon its cause, as far as it. is
its cause3 as a house depends upon the architect for its

construction: although for its duration it depends upon the ,

solidity of the wood and stones. The architect is the
cause of its having been made3 therefore for its making,
i. e. for tlte structure itself it depends upon him: but the
nature of its material is the¹ cause of its actual existence 3
