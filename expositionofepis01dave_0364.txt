foundation, is built the whole system of Indulgences so
profusely vended by Papal bulls.

We, on the other hand, contend ς

1. First, that to all believers and true penitents‚ as well
the expiatory punishment, as the entire guilt, is remitted‚
for the sake of the passion and satisfaction of Christ.

2. We deny that any of the saints ever possessed su-

perabundant merits in themselves, or suffered severer
punishments than their sins deserved.

3. If we allow that those saints vvere harassed and af-
flicted more than their sins deserve, yet we utterly deny
that any accumulation of merits can arise from thence, to
be drawn upon for the remission of other men’s punish-
ments, which they have incurred from divine justice.

Lastly, if there be a store of merits and sufferings at-
tached to the Church (which, as respects the merits and
sufferings of Christ, we willingly acknowledge,) yet we
deny that it is committed to the Pope's custody, οι· that he
has any power by his bulls of assigning the sufferings of
Christ and his saints to men. And now for the proofs of
these positions.

1. Christ the Mediator hath taken upon himself both
the guilt and the punishment due to us, and, by his pas-
sion, hath delivered us from both3 therefore there can be
no need either of our own satisfac-tion, or of those of the
saints, to be applied to us by papal bulls. The antecedent
is easily substantiated by the clearest Scripture authorities.
My blood is slzed for manyfor llze remissiore of sins, Matth.
xxvi. 28. But the remissiore of sin implies nothing more, as
Durandus properly observes, lib. 4, than that it is not im-
pared to usfor punishment· leere is no condemnation to them
who are in Christ Jesus, Rom. viii. l. But condemnationi has
reference properly to the punishment imposed for guilt in
conformity with the sentence of the judge. Whenever,
therefore, condign punishment is inflicted, the sentence of
condemnation has most assuredly preceded. Their iniqui-
ties wisl I remember 720 more, Jer. xxxi. 34. But he who
executes punishment after the guilt has been forgiven,
