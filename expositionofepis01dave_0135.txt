21. Secondly, it is laid down expressly by that article,

I believe in the forgiveness <ff sins. For that which Bellat—
min pretends is not the sense, Ι believe that remissiori

of sins is given in the Church3 which the devil and any
reprobate may believe: but I believe remission of sins to
be given me through Christ, because I believe in him.
This Aquinas himself seems to grant, De justif. art. 4,
where ᾖε says, In the-justffication qf' a sinner, it is not neces-
sary that all the articles offeri-th be in actual contemplation at
the time, but only that God be contemplated asjustifying and
remitting sins,- in which the other articles are implicitly in—
cluded. In quaest. disp. in respon. ad 9mo. Herel ask,
To whom is God regarded as forgiving sins (ἒ Is it to any ’
undefined individual, or to the justified person himself?
Beyond doubt, to that man himself, who is then meditat-

But again he objects, If we are bound to believe the
remissiori of our sins, then whoever does not believe this
is au heretic: but he neither can nor ought to believe this,
who offends wilfully and remains in mortal sin ε therefore
every such sinner is an heretic ; which is contrary to rea*
son.

Bellarmin is deceived in two points : First‚ in this, that
he determines him to be an heretic who does not believe
whatsoever he ought to believe: for not the defect of saith,
whether of act or of habit, constitutes an heretic‚ but a
pertinacious opposition to the doctrine of faith. For, if
every one be an heretic who docs not believe the myster-ies
of the Christian saith, all Gentiles would be heretics ; even
all Christians who are not renewed would be heretics ε for
no one believes any article of faith by scriptural and in-
fused faith, before he has received the gift of saith in re·-
generation. Secondly, that is not by any means sound,
which he says, That a wilful sinner is not bound to believe
the remission of his sins. For heis bound to surrender his
will ; he is bound to repent, and also to believe God, who
promises remission to the penitent. We say not, therefore,
