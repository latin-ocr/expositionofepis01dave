Religion harh reference to G od .· and art. 8, Religion is a vir-
tue exhibiting service to Goa⁷ in those things which especially
pertain to God. Hilary, 8 De Trinit. says, Religion pald to
the creature is accur-sed. From all these testimonies it is
plain that religious worship is to be paid to God alone.

Secondly, the same is evident from clear testimonies of
Scripture. From Deut. vi. 13. 'J'hou shaltfear the Lord thy
God, and him only shalc' thou serve. From Gal. iv. 8, Ye did
service unio them which by nature are no gods ; εδελευσατε. Re-
ligious service ἔκλεισε dulia, therefore, is due only to him who
by nature is God. In Rev. xix. 10, the angel would not be
adored by John z See thou clo it not; Iam thyfellow-servant.
Worship God.

Thirdly, the same is proved by reason. For the founda-
tion of religious worship, whether you call it latria or dn-

reason, therefore, for offering to them, that angels and
saints are endowed with supernatural gifts, or procure for
us many good things, unless they are the first and chief
cause to us, and of our chief good: So says Augustine,
tract. 23, in Evang. John, This is [he Christian religion, to
worship bnt one God ; because only the one God renders the sonl
happy: and lib. 22, contr. Faust. We worship the mar-tyrs
with the worship offellowship and love, whereby they also in
this ly‘e worshipped holy men, Where it is to be observed,
that dead saints are worshipped with the same worship
with which they were whilst alive, and, therefore, not reli-
gious worship.

3. In the third place we must shew, that the Papists as-
cribe to angels, and even to saints, supreme religious wor-
ship, no less than these seducers, who are censured for in-
troducing the worshipping, θρησκειαν, of angels. For Bellar-
min says, that the heresy of Simon Magus is reproved in
this place, who taught that certain angels were to be adored
as lesser gode, because they made the world; and prescrib-
ed sacrifices to be offered to the same, and, in fact, paid to
the angels the highest worship of adoration3 but that this
does not affect the Papists‚ who only render to them dulia,
