362 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAuts Chap.ii.

yet they concur with them virtually. For what they call
omniscience, they nevertheless include within certain li-
mits: whence it is evident they ascribe to the soul of
Christ an omniscience‚ not indeed absolute, which is the
property of the Divine nature, but a certain similitude of
it, and, as it were, the thing itself in a certain relation.
But the Ubiquitarians much more boldly teach that the
very Divine onmiscience was really communicated to the
human nature of Christ, in the same manner as the omni-
potence; Jacobus Andreas, Colloq. Mompelg· tract. de
persona Christi3 where also he brings forward this passage.
We shall set forth the opinion of the Schoolmen, and re-
fute that of the Ubiquitarians, but very briefly.

The Schoolmen, besides the uncreated wisdom of Christ,
allege a manifold created wisdom to bein him. Alexander
Hales, part. 3. qu. 13. memb. l et 2. laid down a fourfold
knowledge in the soul of Christ : The first he calls a know-
ledge hy tlze grace of union ; the second, α knowledge by the
grace of comprehension ; the third, tlze knowledge of a perfect
mam-e,- the fourth, the knowledge of experience. Aquinas,
part. 3. qu. 9. art. l, omits the first ε for he does not think
any new species of knowledge ought to be supposed in the
soul of Christ on account of union3 only he grants that
the knowledge of comprehension is much more clear and
excellent in the soul of Christ because of this union, than
in any of the blessed, whether angels or men. He, there-
fore, attributes a triple knowledge to the soul of Christ;

Μ viz. a blessed, an itffused, and an acquired knowledge. But

now (to come to the point) they ask, whether the soul of
Christ knows all things according to this created wisdom;
whether he hath an equal knowledge of all things with
God 3 and they answer in the affirmative. But when they
attempt to explain their opinion, they say that the know-
ledge of God is to be considered in a twofold manner3 in
respect to God himself, and in respect to creatures. As to
God's knowledge of himself, the soul of Christ does not
know, neither can it know, all things which God knows ;
for it does not know all that God can do; because this
knowledge would comprehend the divine Godhead, which
