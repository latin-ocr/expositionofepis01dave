Ver. 12. EPlSTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 151

God, John i. 12, 133 that from being strangers andforeign-
ers, they may become fellow-citizens with {lie saints, and of
the holtseliold (ff God: Ephes. ii. 19. So Acts xxvi. 18.

But this, although it be a true, is not the full exposition.
I annex, therefore, that other concerning the portion and
heritage to be participated by all the godly. For, as the
Israelites divided the land of Canaan by lot, it hence came
to pass that that inheritance which had been assigned to

each tribe, was called its lot. Hence the lot of Ephraim, .

and the lot of Jndah, &c Josh. xv. 1. Here the Apostle,
alluding to the heavenly inheritanoe, calls it also tite lot of
the saints. He would therefore have the Colossians made
meet not only for participating the condition of children
now, bnt also sor their future inheritance.

In ligna] And because he adds in liglzt, some explain
this of the light of faith3 others, of the light of glory‘:
but the Apostle, methinks, would include both with refer—
ence to the respective periods. For,

l. God renders all his children meet to partake of life
eternal by 3 participatior] of the light of hope and faith com-
menced in this life3 even 35 it is said in John vi. 47, He

have, bnt hath. A true believer, says Clemens, rejoices be-
cause qs those things which. are promised, as already present ,·
ancl being certainly persuaded (ff them, lte already possesses
them, Hionghfnture. Strom. 7.

2. But it must 3150 be added, that they are likewise
made meet to partake of the lot of the saints in the light
of glory, 35 to the future world. For grace is given to the
faithful, that they may be led on to glory3 according to
those words of the Apossse, Rom. viii. 30, PVlzomhepredes-
tinaled, lte called,· whom he called, liejustified; wlmnz leejus-
tffied, lie glorified. God, therefore, 111 effectually calling
and justifying the elect, makes them meet to obtain glory,
i. e. to paitake ο] tlte lot of the saints in light. We are now
in possession of the meaning of the Apostle : hence let us
deduce some observations. ,

1. Inasmuch, as the Apostle says that we are made
meet εἰς μερίδα, not εἰς μεριδας, for α portion of tlze blessed, not
