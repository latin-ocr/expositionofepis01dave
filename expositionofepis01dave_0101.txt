Ver 1. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 10

saying, Itis one thing to spealc concerning authority, and
another thing concerning the execution (ff it: that the Pope
hath the authority of ordaining in the provinces of other
Bishops ,χ buc that custom- has established his non-exertion of
this authority. If he hath this authority by right, it could
not be so abolished by custom as to make that ordination
actually unlawful which he might effect without the con-
sent of the Metropolitan 3 for castom does not prescribe
where a thing is forbidden by an express low, says Hosti-
ensis.* We do not deny that prerogatives have been con-

the close of the fourth century, in giving his sense of the oth Canon of this
Synod, is admitted to have stated it truly and clearly3 viz. That the an-
cient custom be kept both in Alexandria and Rome; that he (the Bishop of
Alexandria) have the care of Egypt; the other (the Bishop of Rome) of ·
the Suburbicary Churches, i. e. over all those places in Italy, Sicily, Sardi- ·
nia, Corsica, διε. over which the Praefect, or the Vicar of the City of Rome,
had jurisdiction in temporal affairs. And even the old Latin paraphrastical
Version of these Canons confines the jurisdiction of the Bishop ofRome to
the Suburbicary Churches. And not only these two Editions of the Ca-
nons, but those of other writers on them, call the several districts in which
the Bishops of Rome and Alexandria exercised theirjurisdiction, Provinces ,-
whereas the district of a Patriarch was always called his Diocese, that of an
inferior Bishop his Parz'sh: And therefore by lVIetropolitans here must be
meant those who had the largest Provinces, or were the most remarkable on
account of the largeness of cities, and had a proportionable deference paid
to them. The reason why such particular care was taken of the privileges
of the Bishop of Alexandria was, that Bleletius, Bishop of Lyeopolis, being
deposed about twenty years before this Council, by Peter, Bishop of Alex-
andria, in a provincial Synod, for idolatry and other crimes, did yet ordain
several Bishops and Clergymen in Egypt, without the consent, and in oppo-
sition to the sentence passed against him by the Bishop and Synod. Against
this the 4th Canon of the Council was probably framed :—“ A Bishop
ought to be constituted by all the Bishops that belong to the Province; but
if this be not practicable, by reason of urgent necessity, or the length of the
way, Three must by all means meet together, and when they have the con-
sent of those that are absent, signified by letter, then let them perform the
ordination3 and the ratification of what is done must be allowed to the Me-
tropolitan in every Province.''

Letit further be observed, that the authority of Metropolitans must

have been much older than this synod ; for here their privileges are called
ancient customs. Vide J ohnson's Clergyman's Vade Mecum.
