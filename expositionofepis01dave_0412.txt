326 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL’s Chnp. i.

Hence we infer,
1. That the Ministry is, as it were, the hand of God
himself reforming and perfecting men in spiritual life;
which, if we speak of the subject of degrees of perfectiori,
is done very gently and gradually. For, as Prosper says,
De vita contempl. l. 9, no man is in this life completely per-
fect ,· for the itfirmities of the godly are not yet healed, though
they are under the dail-z] process cys healing. Hence that ad-
dress of Paul, Gal. iv. 19, My little children, of whom I

travail in birth until Christ be formed inyoa.

2. Hence also is shewn the empty pride of the Monks
in claiming to themselves alone that state of perfection
which is within the reach of every true Christian. For it
is quite absurd to suppose that a good Christian cannot be
in the way of perfection without turning Franciscan or
Dominican; when Paul, who wished to present all men
perfect in Christ Jesus, yet never attempted to persuade one
to bind himself down by any sort of monastic vows and
mles. But let us hear that grave theologiam John Gerson,
who beats down this pride of the Monks upon all occa-
sions. In his work Contra assert. Matthaei de Grabbonfiss
part. l, he maintains the following propositions: l. The
Christian religion may be observed pelfectlffi yea, most per-
fecHy, independently of any vow obliging to counsels (ff per-
fection. (This he proves by the example of Christ, the
Apostles, and the saints in the primitive Church, who were
under no vows or monastic discipline whatever). 2. It is
the height of impropriety, perversion, and, I scraple not to add,
arrogance, to call these factitions religious institutes, states of
perfectiore, when it is certain the most imperfect men are pro-
fessors of such obligations. 3. The religion of? Christ may be
and ought to be observed by the prelates of the Char-ch more
perfectly than by the Monlss. And in the third part of his
work, he brings many arguments to prove that the perfec-
tion of a Christian does by no means consist in the vow of

³¹ Grabbon appears to have been a Monk of the 15th century, who main-
tained some peculiar notions on this subject, which were condemned in the
Couneil of Basil. Vide Du Pin, cap. viii. Ceut-xv.
