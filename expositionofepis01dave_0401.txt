Ver. 27. ErisTLE TO THE COLOSSMNS. 315

glory‚ not of fleeting vanity, but of eternal blessedness.
It is, therefore, our business to seek for glory in the way
of this glorious mystery3 according to the exhortation of
Christ, Matth. vi. 33, Seehye first the kingdom of God and
his righteousnes5, and all [hese things shall be added unio you.
Ye see, then, that the treasures of riches and glory are
offered to us in the Gospel: And now let us consider in
whom these riclies and this glory are vested, and how they
are derived to us.

Which is Christ in you, the hope ofglory] The relative

Divine acceptance into life eternal, as far as we are reckon-
ed in Christ the Head, and are found clothed With the gar-
ment of his perfect righteousness. In Christ, therefore,
all our riches are laid up3 in Christ is all our hope ofglory.

But inasmuch as it is but too clear and evident‚ that all
men are not made partakers of these riches3 therefore, in
the second place, the Apostle adds how Christ is made the
