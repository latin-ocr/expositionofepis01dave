Ver. 9. EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS. 113

Itnportunity in prayer is commanded in Scripture3 We
ought always to pray, and not tofaint; Luke xviii. l. Pray
without ceasing, l Thess. v. 17. lee constant prayer qf a
rz'gltleous man availetlc much, James v. 16.

But it may be said, How is it possible that Paul should
never desist from prayer, when the weakness of human na-
ture will not sustain continual praying? nay, the Euchitae,
or Messaliani‚ who made constant prayer the pretext of
indolence and sluggishnessj are reckoned among heretice.
Theodor. lib. 4. A ugustine, torn. vi. De haeres.

I answer, We are said not to cease from prayer, or not
to leave off praying for any thing, when we have a fixed
desire of that thing in our heart. So Augustine, in Psalm
xxxvii. Thy desire is thy prayer; {f tlzere be α continual de-
sire, there is continual prayer.

Secondly, we are said not to faint, or not to cease from
praying, when we exercise it in its proper time and place.
For it is idleness in a man. and he ceases from his work,
which he does not perform when he can and ought.

In either respect, therefore, Paul said truly, We ceasenot
to prayforyou. For there was both a perpetual desire in
his mind (at least as to the habit) of promoting their good3
and that also, as much as in him lay, he did promote by
his prayers, as often as opportunity of praying offered it-
self to him.

Obsewe, then, the duty of the pastor is not only to
teach his flock, and to commend them to God in public
prayers, but also in his private prayer he ought never to
he uumindful of the people committed to his care. Thus
Samuel was actuated towards the people of God, {je itflzr
from me lo sin against tlze Lord in. ceasing to prayforyou ;

l Sam. xii. 23. So our Apostle, God is my witness, whom I

thousands of augeb, who, together‘with the many-eyed Cherubim and six-
winged Seraphim, sing, aud declare and proclaim this song of triumph.”
