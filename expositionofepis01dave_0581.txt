carnal celebration, therefore, now end, when the spiritual
signification shines forth: for what need is there of a little
lamp in the splendour of the sun?

Thir‘dly, it is not now proper to retain the ceremonies.
because far better things are substituted in their places·
For Christ hath abrogated the ancient rites, not by con-
demning them, but fulfilling them: for he so removed the
shadows and representations‚ as to exhibit to men the
substantial and real body in their room. Whence that de-
claration of Augustine, Advers. Judaeos, lee people of*
Christ are not now compelled to obser-ve what they observed in
tlte times (ff tlte prophets, not because those things are condemn-
ed, but because they are clzangedj'or the better.

And here just occasion presents itself for reproving·
those who, notwithstanding this abrogation of the cere-
monies, are so delighted u ith shadows, that they place more
holiness in following rites and human traditions than in
obeying the Gospel. But of this superstition we shall have
occasion to treat hereafter. Let it now suffice to have
spoken thus much concerning the argument of the Apos-
tle derived from analogy, or the relation of the body to
the shadow.
