doctrine of the Gospel, as we have it delivered to us in the
sacred Scriptures, from the Son3 and a third Gospel still

eterna! Gospel. But if the Gospel which we have, is the
Gospel as well of God as of Christ, either the Holy spirit
is denied to be God, or this Gospel must be ascribed to
him, and no new one expected from him.

and by the Council of Arles in 1260, without, as is said, reflecting on the
orthodoxy of the author. It is, however, not to be wondered at that Joa-
chim's writings should have been thus condemned, he was renowned for
learning and piety, and asserted that Antichrist was born in the Roman
state, and would be exalted to the Apostolic See. Vide Milner, vol. iii.
