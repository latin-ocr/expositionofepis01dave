Ver. 15. EP1sTLE To THE coLoss1ANS. 181

For we know God either by causality, or by remotiori,
or by emineneeJ* By cansalz'ly ; whilst we contemplate the
Creator, through the creatures of which God is the cause.
But notwithstanding this knowledge, the essence of God
remains invisible: because an effect shews not the essence
of its cause, unless when it is of the sanie species with the
cause, or demonstrates the whole virtue of the cause.

We know God by remotion: when we consider the 1111-
perfections of the creatures, and perceive them to be re-
mote from God3 as conceiving him to be immortaL not
susceptible of suffering, and incapable of sin. But this
knowledge does not extend to the Divine essence: for con-
siderations of remoteness indicate negatively what God is
not3 they do not shew positively what he is, For no pri-
vation belongs to the essence of a positive existence.

We know God by eminence, when, after considering the
perfectioris of the creatures, we ascribe them to God in the
highest degree of excellency3 thus, because wisdom,
strength, holiness, are perfections in the creatures, there-
fore wejudge God to be perfectly strong, perfectly ivise,
perfectly lloly. But neither in this way do we rise to a
perception of the essence of God, because none of these
things are predicated of God, and of the creature univo-
oally. Aquin. Quaest. disput. De simp. div. essen. art. 4.

To this threefold way of knowing God add also that
knowledge which we have by saith 3 and yet then the di-
vine essence remains invisible. For so Paul himself con-
fesses, ] Cor. xiii. 12, We see now through a gloss darlsly.
For faith shews rather what sort of a being God is towards
us, than what he is in his own essence. Therefore God in
himself is to us invisible.

2. But we must also add that God in the person of the
Father may be said to be invisible by a certain special mean-

* “ Cognoscimus enim Deum vel per causalitatem, vel per remotionem,
vel per eminentiam.” 11 is scarcely needful to obser-ve how impracticable
it is to render these and other technical phrases of the School divinity, which
occur 111 this work, into English, with any thing like precision. They be-
come sufficiently perspicuous, hoxvever, by the tenor of the passages in
which they are employed.
