The States of Holland had no sooner established their freedom
from the Spanish yoke, than they were embroiled in theological
contentions, which soon became intermingled with political cabals.
Γ1 he awful doctrine of the Divine decrees had been placed by the
Belgic Confession and Catechism, in common with most of the
other Creeds of the Reformed Churcbes, in the sacred and unde-
fined simplicity of the Scriptures. ssut, in the period immediately
subsequent to the Reformation, the prying· curiosity of men, anx-
ious to be wise above what is written, proceeded to the attempt of
accurate and precise explanation of what is evidently inexplicable.
When, therefore, the supralapsarian scheme began to take place
of the moderate system hitherto adopted, it was opposed, on the
other side, by those who, in their eagerness to sustain the free-
dom of human will, dangerously entrenched upon the freedom of
Divine grace.

These disputes, however, led to no important consequences,
until, in 1591, they centered‚ as it were, in Jarnes Arminius, pro-
fessor of Divinity in the University of Leyden, a man who joined
to unquestionable piety and meekness of spirit, a clear and acute
judglnent‚; and who had obtained no slight eminence by the talent
with which be had extricated the doctrines of Christianity from
the dry and technical mode in which they had hitherto been stated
and discussed. His celebrity placed him in a situation ill-suited
to his habits and temper. As a pupil of Beza, he had embraced
the extreme views to which that divine had carried the tenets ad-
vocated by the powerful pen of Calvin. lt happened that one
Coornhert had advanced some opinions, which, if not loose in
themselves, were, at least, expressed in a very unguarded way.
The Ministers of Delft published a reply: in which the moderate
and generally received sublapsarian hypothesis was sustained;
which gave little less offence to the high Calvinists than did the
heterodox lang-uage of Coornhert. Arminius, therefore, as the
most talented Divine of the day, was applied t0, in order to take
up the pen, 011 both sides. On the one hand, his friend Martin
Lydius, solicited him to vindicate the supralapsarian views of his
former tutor, Beza, against the reply of the Ministers: and, on
the other, he was invited by the Synod of Ainsterdam, to defend
this same reply against Coornhert. Flac-ed in this remarkable si-
tuation, Arminius felt compelled to enter into an examination of
the whole question, and was induced to change his sentiments,
and to adopt that view of the Divine DispensatIOns which now
