titles, or not: indeed, the more probable supposition is.
that different names are given them, according to the dif-
ferent offices to which they are commissioned.

But a question remains to be resolved, viz. When were
these arigels created [² The Apostle says, they were crea-
ted by Christ3 but Moses does not mention angels among
the works of the creatio-n.

Dismissing those Philosopliers who insist upon the eter-
nal existence of these spiritual substances, the opinions of
Divines on this point are. twofold. Some think they were
created before this visible world ς and in this opinion almost
all the Greek Fathers coincide. Basil says that before this
world there was another ἀθεωρηἿον καὶ ἀνιστόρηἹον, invisible, and
wnlescribesl by ΙῬνΙοεεεῇἔ on account oftlze stupidity oftlze Jew-
ish marion: and he affirms, that in this more ancient world‚'
those thrones, domininus, and powers existed, of which the
Apostle speaks. Chrysostoin and Nazianzen are of the
same opinion ; and among the Latin Fathers we may reckon
Jerome and Hilary.

To confirm this notion, that expression of Job xxxviii.
4, 7, is first alleged, Wlaere wast thou when l laid thefozm-
dations of elie earth—when tlte morning stars sang together,
and all the sous of God shouted for 'jo-y? By the Sons of
God they understand the angeIS, and hence infer their ex·
istence before the foundation of the world.

But it is answered, We are not authorised to conclude
from this expression, that angels were created before the
visible world, but before the earth was founded, i. e. before
the dry land was formed. Moreover‚ it may be said,
that though the angels were created at the same time with
the world, yet they might very possibly be enabled to
praise the Creator of the world from the first moment of
their existence.

And therefore their opinion is the more probable, who
suppose that the angels were created at the same time with
the heaven of the blessed3 and they say that there is a
synecdoche (a part put for the whole) in those words of

³* *⁶ Intelligibile et a Mose non descriptum.''
