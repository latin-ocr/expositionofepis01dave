l. In this, that a minister should always regard the ho-
nour of his Lord, not his own glory. But he regards the
honour of God, who so speaks as the eracles (ff God, that
God in all things may be glorffied, l Pet. iv. 113 and he
seeks his own glory who so speaks that he may please vain
men, and be commended by them either on account of
genius, or learning, or eloquence. Concerning this desire
of vain-glory, Paul says to the Galatians, i. 10, Do Iseelc

that direction of Prosper3 Let them not in preachz'ng place

own prcfit, but tlte profit of many, tlzat they may be saved, l
Cor. x. 33. But, to exhibit this faithfulness, it will be
useful for every one constantly to propose to himself these
three circumstances3 Who‘? What? To whom?

Who he is, let him first of all carefully consider. He is
not a private man, nor free, and master of himself3 but an
ambassador and servant of Christ : wherefore it behoves the
