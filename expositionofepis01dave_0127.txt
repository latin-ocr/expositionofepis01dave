Ver. 2. EPISTLE 'ro THE COLossiANS. 41

Ephes. iii. 12, and Heb. x. 22. But he who continues
doubting, and ignorant whether he be a child of God or
not; whether he be in a state of enmity or reconciled3 he
cannot approach the throne of grace with this confidence3
he cannot call God his Father, but with the greatest hesi-
tation3 much less can he confidently ask those things
which are necessary for salvation from him, as from a
Father.

Bellarmin rejoins, For enabling us to approach the throne
of grace with confidence, it is not necessary that we be
certain of our justification in particular; a positive assur-
ance from the Catholic saith, that Christ suffered for us,
died, rose again, and intercedes with the Father, is suf-
ficient. ι

But this reply is invalid3 because although it may be a
general truth that the death of Christ was sufficient for
all; yet is it also true, that the fruit of the death, of the
resurrection, and of the intercession of Christ, actually
belong only to those who are implanted into Christ3 that
I should be sure, therefore, the benefits of Christ belong
to me, it is necessary I should be sure also, that Ι am be-
come a member of Christ, i. e. am justified and reconciled
to God. For, if Ι doubt whether I am effectually called
andjustified, Ι must also doubt, whether I am without
Christ, without God, αη alien to the commonwealllz of Israel,
aud a scr-anger to tlte covemmts of promise, or not, Ephes. ii.
12. When all these things are left in doubt, what place is
there for confidence‘?

These are our arguments: several others we shall omit
for the sake of brevity. Now let us proceed to

The arguments of the Papists,

Bellarmin, De justif. lib. iii. cap. 4, endeavours to prove

the uncertainty of grace and of the remission of sins,
From the ScriptureS.

1. From Prov. xx. 9, Who can say I have made my
heart clean, I am pure from my sin? Although therefore
some may be clean from sin, yet they themselves do not

know it, neither have they an infallible testimony of their
purity and righteousness.
