Ver. 9. EPISTLE To THE corossmns. lll

wish real blessings to another3 but real blessings are these
spiritual ones, which render the possessors good. Hence,
though the A'postle most tenderly loved all those to whom
he sent his EpistleS, yet we no where read that he sought
honours or riches for them from God, but faith, love, ho-
liness, patience, and other things of the like kind.

2. It ought especially to stir us up to pray for our
brethren‚ when we perceive in them the first fruits of the
spirit and of renovation, and, as it were, the seeds of
piety. For so Paul, because he understood the fundamen-
tals of Religion to have been laid in the Colossians, on this
very account, more earnestly sought from God the increase
of the same graces. We may observe the like in his Epis-
tle to thebEphesians, i. 15, 16, Having heardwhatfaith and
love is in you, I cease not to give thanhsfor you, making men-
tion of you in my prayers, &c- Chrysostom illustrates this
by an elegant similitude : As in the race, says he, we espe-
cially wish well to, and excite hy our encouragement and om·
cheers, those who are not far from victory,· so in this ναι-ε of
the Christian life, we ought chiefly to favour aud assist with
our prayers those whom we perceive pressing with alacrity to
the destined goalffi--And so much concerning the motive.

* John Chrysostom flourished toward the close of the fourth century.
He was a native of Antioch, born of a noble family in that city about the
year 3543 and became, as he advanced in years, so celebrated and admired
for his attainments and virtues, (being, by the care of his mother, like Au-
gustine, instructed in Christianity), that at an assembly of Bishops, it was
resolved to enrol him among their body. On hearing this, Chrysostom re-
tired to the summit of a mountain, in company with an old man, and after-
wards entirely secluded himself in a dreary cave, from all converse with
mankind. But his health suffering in this state, he returned to Antioch,
the Bishop whereof soon promoted him to the‘ office of a Presbyter, and his
reputation as a preacher became so great, that, on the death of the Patri-
arch of Coustantinople, he was, by general consent, elected to that dignity 3
but to proceed to his See he was obliged to leave Antioch privately, the
people being unwilling to part with him. At Constantinople he commenced
a reform of the abuses among the Clergy, who had been suffered to relax
through the negligence of his predecessor: he retrenched a great part of
the expences in which Nectarius had lived, in order to feed the poor and
build hospitals ς and he preached with the utmost zeal and plainness against
the pride, luxury, and avarice of the great. His attention to the condition
of his Clergy, led to 1115 justly admired discourses on the Priesthood. His
