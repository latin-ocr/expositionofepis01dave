appears to have been no contemptible adversary. His work is in
the form of an Epistle; from which we find, he had originally
held the views which he there took up his pen to refute: for he
commences with this remark, “ Ι have sent you here my reasons
which have moved me to change my opinion in some controver-
sies of late debated between the Remonstrants and their oppo-
nents.” These treatises, thus united in one publication, seem to
compress all that has been said in so many volumes on this sub-
ject. Hoard accumulates every argument in opposition to the
Calvinistic views, and presses them with considerable energy: but
in no work is the acuteness of Davenant’s powerful mind more
exhibited than in his reply. He maintains‚ with extraordinary

not a fleeting or uncertain conjecture only, but a true and solid
knowledge os our election‚ we must have recourse to the fore-
named uses, and by them make trial whether our conceit of our
elec—tion be a deceitful illusion, or a true persuasion springing from
