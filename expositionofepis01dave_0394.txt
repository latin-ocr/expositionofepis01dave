308 AN EXPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL's Chap. i.

2. Wisdom unto salvation belongs only to the saints
and to the godly: the ungodly and the unholy have the
mystery of salvation preaehed to them, but they do not re-
ceive it, unto salvation3 for hearing they do not hear, and
understanding they do not understand. Wisdom does not
enter into α wicked heart, nor will dwell in a body that is subject
to sin. For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, Wis-
dom. Ch. i. ver. 4. True wisdom in the mysteries of God is
ever accompanied with sanctity, but iniquity with folly.

But, as was before stated, others understand by the word
saints, the ApostleS, Sco. to whom that hidden mystery was
manifested in some extraordinary manner. If we admit this
explanation, we must understand an extraordinary and im-
mediate manifestation by the Holy Spirit3 for the Holy
spirit revealed the mystery of salvation to the Apostles im·
mediately, that through the medium of their ministry it
might be revealed to all others. But the Comforter, which is
the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall
teach you. John xiv. 26.

That we, then, may obtain the full meaning of the Apos-
tle, let us unite these separate interpretatione, in one, and
conclude thus : This mystery is manifested primarily to the
Holy ApostleS, and secondarily to other saints3 immediately
to the ApostleS, mediately to all the servants of God.

Verse 27.
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is
Christ in you, the hope of glory.

Having treated in the foregoing verse on the conoealed
and manifested mystery of salvation, let us now proceed
with the Apostle, who does three things in this one verse :

l. He adds the reason why that mystery, hidden from
so many ages past, should now be revealed to the saints.
