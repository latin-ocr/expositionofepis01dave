Ver. 16. ερῐετιε το THE conossmNs. 481

have been exere-ised therein‚ Heb. xiii. 9. Well spake Pros—
per, De vita contempl. lib. 3, cap. 19. It is α miserable thing
to condemn others for receiving meat or drinh, or to arrogale
sanccz'ty to ourselvessor abstinence. And Tertullian, De cib.
J udaie Evangelical liberty has taken away the observances of
meats. The true aud pure meat is α conscience undefiled.

Here, therefore, we blame a double error of the Papists.
First, in this they grievously err, and approach very near
the Tatians* and Manichaeans‚ because they forbid certain
meats at certain times, on the ground that they think
them more cursed and less holy than others. For when
they would assign a reason why it is not lawful to eat flesh
at the time of fasting, although it is permitted to feed ,
upon fishg they pretend that the earth is cursed by God,
and, as a consequence, all earthly animals are so3 that the
water, with the fish, was not put under the curse3 that
Christ was accustomed to eat fisb, not flesh3 by which ar-
guments they affirm that they believe fishes to be in them-
selves more holy and clean than flesh. Secondly, they
further err in this, that they place the merit of I know not
what extraordinary perfectiori in abstinence from meat:
whence it comes to pass that to the Carthusian monks, who
would be accounted more perfect and holy than the rest,
the use of flesh is forbidden for ever, and to all others dur-
ing Lent. That remark of Augustine‚ Serm. De tempore
157, may fitly be brought against them, There are certain
observers <ff Lent vmore delicate than religious ,· seelce‘ng rather
new delia-acies, than chastising old lzcsls. They shndder at {he
‘vessels in which flesh z's coolced, as though these were mzclecm ,-
hut they dread noc the luxury of the appetite ancl glutcowy.

⁴‘ The disciples of Tatian, a heretic of the second century. Regarding
matter as the source of all evil, he contended‚ that the body ought to be se-
verely mortified; and urged his disciples to abstain from wine and animal
food. They acted upon his notions to such a degree, asto reject with a sort
of horror all the comforts and conveniences of life, and abstained from wine
with such a rigorous obstinacy as to use nothing but water even at the ce-
lebration of the Lord's supper! Hence they were also denominated En-
cratites, or 'rempe1·ate; Hydroparastates, or Vssater-drinkers; and Apo-
tactites, or Ren‹›uncers.—'l'he M2211ichaeans held some similar notions‚ vide
art. Note, p. 226.
