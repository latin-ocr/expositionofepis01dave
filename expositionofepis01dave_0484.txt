by a happy similitude: As they wlzo would address the people
do this most commonly bys α public crier, chat the things which
are said, may be heard by all ,· so when> de'sconrse is to be held
with men ignorant of the Christian Religion, the opinions and
expressions of nature its-esf, which may be perceived and under-
stood by them, are to be employed.

But now as to what belongs to the conflict with philoso⁶
phers speaking against Religion, who does not see that it
is necessary to be armed with philosophy? For it is like
a trench and rampart against their inroads; it is a sword
wherewith to thrust them : which, although it renders the
truth in no ways more powerfuL yet it is very useful in

to adorn and enrich our dissertations on sacred things with
the good sayings of philosophers. For the good sctyirzgs (ff
philosophers, says Justin Mart. Apolog. l, are the heritage of
Chrz'stiaus. For Ι agree not with those who think that not
only the remarks of philosophers‚ but of the most holy
Fathers, should be altogether withheld from sacred dise
courses. Prosper, in Praefat. ad 2, lib. de vita contempla-
tiva, seems to me to decide much better: Truth, says he,

from what qzmrter soever it sln‘nes, z's not to be ascribed lo hn-
man wit, but to God; neither ought it to be believed to be the
property of some, but of all, which is such and so great of
