ceeded to frame their decrees, with the rejection of the opposite
errors. And here the share of the British deputies happily ter-
minates, as they had no part in the subsequent transactions. The
Synod immediately followed up its decisions by a sentence against
the Remonstrants‚ depriving them of all their offices‚ interdicting
them from all ecelesiastical services and academica] functions, and
finally exhorting the States-General to enforce these Canons with
the secular arm. Nor did this recommendation slumber. Politics
had intermingled with all the proceedings. Maurice, Prince of
Orange, was aiming at despotic authority, and found the Armi-
nians his most powerful opponents. Hence, though an Arminian
himself, he sided with the Synod‚ and, from secular motives, se-
conded their views. A series of disgraceful persecutions followed,
in which some of the most virtuous and patriotic blood of Holland
was shed; and this, doubtless, contributed to render the Synod
generally odious‚ and to promote that decline of doctrinal Cal-
vinism in Eughmd, which is so commonly said to have resulted
from this conventi0n.*

Of all assemblies, Religious Councils are most likely to be
misrepresented. As few were more open to attack, so there are
scarcely any which have been more grossly and unfairly assailed,
than the Synod of Dort. By a series of authors in successiou, a
treacherous copy of its decreeS, under the shape of an abridg-
ment, has passed current. Forinstance, the Syn0d‚ cap. l, art.
l, asserts, that ‘⁶ God bath elected out of the common mass of
simzers, cz certain multitude of men—quorundam hominum certa
multitudo‚'' &a but that he hath left the rest to condemnation,
“ not only on account of their infidelity, but also their other
sins—non tantum propter infidelitatem, sed etiam cetera omnia

³⁵ Of an assembly of which so little commendable may be said, it must
be noted, that they ordered a new 'l‘ranslation of the Bible sor the United
Provinces, with Annotations: “ In which work they were assisted by many
eminent and able divines from most of the Reformed Cliurches, and parti-
cularly from England by Dr. G. Carleton, Bishop of Chichester3 Dr. J.
Davenant‚ Bishop of Sarum; Dr. Hall, Bishop of Exon; and Dr. Samuel
WVard, of Cambri<lge3 by whose great and assiduous labour, jointly for
many years together, the said Annotations were eompleted, and came forth
in print, first, ann. 1637.” A.Wood'sAthenae. 410. iv. 279. This Bible‚ with
the Notes, was translated into English, and published in 1657, in two vols.
folio, by Theodore Haak, under the title of “ The Dutch Annotations
upon the whole Bible; together with the Translation‚ according to the di-
rection of the Synod of Dort, 1618.‘’
