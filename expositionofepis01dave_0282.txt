quence. These opinions are collected from Dionysius,
from Gregory the Great (hom. in Evang. 34), and from the
Schoolmen; and in collectiug them together I have fol-
lowed their more generally received opinions ς for they are
by no means agreed among themselves on these subjects3
some of them referring the ‘virtues to the second class, and
the principalilies to the last3 others again opposing this ar-
rangement.

Our Divines treat this subject with a more becoming re-
serve. For though they admit these different titles‚ which
are found in this passage and others, as marking distinctions
both of order and dignity amongst t'ne angels themselves3
yet, inasmuch as the Scriptures do not explain what these
distinctions are, or in what they consist, they do not pre-
sume to discuss and define them. So Augustine before
them observed, What is {he aclztczl distinclz'on between lliese
titles, let those say who can; at the same time, le! them prove
voleat they say .- jin* myselfl am content to cmffess my ignorance
of them. Enchirid. cap. 58. And iu another place, ad
Oros. contra Priscill. cap. xi. tom. 6, leat there are distinc-
tions of some kind, J believe, bnt what those distinctions are I
know not. Therefore, passing by these speculations, we
will infer the following corollaries :

l. As for the angels, even the most perfect of them, to
whatever degree of dignity advanced, Christ is above
them all; being himself their Creator and their Disposer.
Whence that observation‚ Heb. i. 6, Let all the (ηιξ-615 wor-
ship him.

2. Neither the offices of Christ are to be attributed, nor
divine worship paid, to the angels3 since they are the ser-
vants and creatures of our Redeemer.

3. The different titles by which they are distinguished,
do not so much express their inequality in natural dig-mity,
as the difference of offices which they seem to discharge
in the affairs of men. For from this difference of offices,
smne of which are more diguified than others5 they receive
thise titles of engeis, arcliangels, principalilies, powets, &c-
Nor are we able to state, for a certainty, whether the same
angels always perform the same duties, and retain the same
