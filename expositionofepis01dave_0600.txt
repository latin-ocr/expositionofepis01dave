touch Christ, Christ us, and one another mutually, and by
whom all gifts are derived to us. And among these gifts
saith obtains the primary place, by which, as a secondary
mean, we are united to Christ, and by which we receive
the righteousness of Christ, the remission of sins, and all
the grace promised in the Gospel by Christ. Iam tlte bread
of [ᾖα he that comella to me shall never hunger, aud- he that
believetlz on me shall never thirst, John vi. 35. Faith‚ there-
fore, is that otherjoint by which we are united to Christ,
and by the operation of which the grace of the Gospel is
derived to us. For the whole body which thus adheres to
Christ the Head by the Spirit and by saith, lzatlz mouri-slt-
ment minister-ed, as we translate ἐπιχορηγεῖται. What is the
force of this term? The Greeks call him χορηγὸν who snp-
plied all the apparatus to the leaders of the antient sacred
dances. By a metaphor derived from this, he is said
χορηγεῖν, to supply the expenditure, who furnishes to another
the things necessary for any particular object: and
ἐπιχορηγεῖν, the word used by the Apostle‚ signifies the
doing of this copiously and abundantly. When, therefore,
it is said, that the whole body of the Church hath, by the
joinls afore-mentioned, ›soar-istiment ministered, the Apostle
intends that all things necessary to its salvation are by
Christ abundantly supplied to his Church cleaving to him.
For whether (to use the terms of the Schools) we regard
grace making grateful, or grace gratuitously given, Christ
abundantly communicates both to his Church by his Spirit3
so that every thing is supplied to it by its Head which it
can even wish in order to life eternal. Of that grace which
has respect to the justification and sanctific-atior] of any
particular person, the Apostle testifies‚ in Rom. viii. lO, and
2Cor. viii.9, that it is ministered to all his members by
Christ. As to that which relates to the edification of the
Church, those gifts of grace are likewise abundantly minis-
tered to the Church3 l Cor. xii. 7, διο. and Ephes. iv. ll,
12. Thus much as to the prior effect. We may here
observe,
1. In the whole body of the Church is not found a
single dry member, but all are watered by the streams of
grace flowing froin Christ the Head.
