74 AN EXPOSITmN or ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

founded upon the communication of divine blessedness‚

whatever may participate that blessedness may be the ob-
ject of love. But now, although our body cannot enjoy
the divine blessedness in knowing and in loving God, yet
it may be the instrument in many works of piety of a soul
that does know and love Gocl 3 whence from the beatifica-
tion of the soul redounds a certain incidental blessedness
to the body, viz. the blessedness of immortality and inca-
pability of suffering—So much concerning the objects of
love. Now let us consider the extent of that object which
is here expressed by the Apostle. He would have love to
extend to all saints, i. e. professors of true religion.

All.] When the Apostle extends love to all saints, he is
to be understood, not only concerning the inter-nal affec-
tion, but the external exercise of love, which is discerned
in liberality and beneficence towards those who stand in
need of our aid, For, as much as in us lies, we ought to
be beneficent towards all, not only our neighbours or rela-
lations, but strangerS, nay enemies and wicked mem*
Concerning strangers we have the practice of the apostolic
Church: The Macedonians and Achaians made a collec-
tion for the poor saints that dwelt at Jerusalem, Rom. xv.
26. So the Corinthians are excited to supply the wants of
others from their abundance‚ 2 Epis. viii. 13ss So Gaius
is praised for his love toward strangers, 3 Epis. John, ver.

'¹ Who can forget the exemplifications given us of this by our Redeemer
in the parable of the good Samaritan, and as implied in Rom. v. 6-10 ?

† Tertullian in his “ Apology,'‘ cap. 39, gives a fine illustration of the
effects of the Gospel in inducing this Christian love z “ Every one,'’ says
he, speaking of the conduct of the early Christians, ‘⁴ pays something into .
the public chest once a month, or when he pleases, and according to his
ability and inclination 3 for there is no compulsion. These gifts are, as it
were, the deposits of piety: Hence we relieve and bury the needy, support
orphans and decrepit persons, those who have suffered shipwreck, and those
who, for the word of God, are condemned to the mines or imprisonment.
This very charity of ours has caused us to be noticed by som'e :—See‚ say
they, how these Christians love one another .''³.-The world had not before
witnessed the like; and surely these persons had learned of him whose be-
nevolence ‘⁶ excludes no persons from its tender regards3 which disdains no

condescensioni, grudgesno eost, in its labours of love.'' Luke xix. 10; 2
Cor. viii. 9.
