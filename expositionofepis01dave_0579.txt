Ver. 17. musrts To THE conossrANs. 493

of Abraham, John viii. 56, He saw tlze day of Clzrist and
was glad,- and it is shewn of all, Heb. xi. 13, These all died
insnum, not having received tlze promises ,· but having seen them
afar off.

2. But tlte body is of Christ] That is, In Christ we
have those true and solid benefits which were shadowed
forth and figured in the aforesaid ceremonies. It will not
be necessary to run through the ceremonies minutely: For
whether they shadowed forth moral purity, this Christ
clearly taught, perfectly exhibited3 whether they engaged
for the expiation of sin, this Christ merited for us upon the
Cross: or promised the participation of heavenly bless-
ings, this also Christ communicated to all his people by the
Gospel: to sum up all in a word 3 Whatever good was con-
cealed in the legal shadows, that we have revealed and
held forth by Christ and the Gospel. Upon this, Tertul-
lian, De Trinit. remarks, The authority oftlze Old [l'estameut
totters not, wleilst it is uplzeld by the revelation of the New,-
ποι· is the power of tlze New Testament cut (ff whilst v't is rooted
on tlte Old. And Lactantius, in Instit. 4, cap. 20, says,
lee Testaments are not dffl'erent ‚· for tlte New is nothing else.
than the completion of tlze Old, ami iu each there is tlte same
Testator-—Christ The time, therefore, of the Old Testa-
ment was the time of signifying3 but this, of manifesting:
that was a time in which the good things to be exhibited
were prefigured by shad0ws3 this is the time in which the
truth itself, and the body of things so prefigured, is exhi-
bited, according to that word of John, lee law was given
by BIoses, but grace ond trulla came by Jesus Christ, John i.
17. On many accounts, therefore, the Mosaic rites are
compared to shadmos: but Christ, and the grace of the
Gospel exhibited with Christ, to tlze body:

l. Because as the body is the cause of the shadow, not
vice versa3 so Christ was the cause of the Mosaic
rites3 and he, therefore, had power to abolish the same by
his coming.

2. Because as the shadow is the sign of the body;
so the types and figures were the signs of Christ to be ex-

hibited.
