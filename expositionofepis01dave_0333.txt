corruption, into the glorious liberty of tlze children of God.
To whom, therefore, will this whole fabric of the world
owe its restoration and renovation? Doubtless to Christ
the Son of God, our Creator and Restorer, who, dying
without sin, won the privilege of being the restorer of all
things which were fallen to ruin by sin. It may not, there-
fore, be improperly said, that Christ hath reconciled all
things to God, as well tlze things that be in earth, as the things
tlzat be in heaven ,- men peculiarly, by taking away their sins,
and the wrath of God occasioned by sin: angels analogi-
cally: by taking away the possibility of their falling and of
incurring the Divine anger: the fabric of the world meta-
phorically; in delivering it fron] the bondage of corruption,
and restoring it to its native purity and beauty, when the
fulness of the time shall come3 according to that declara--
tion, 2 Pet. iii. 13. We loolcfor new heavens and a new earth,
according to his promise—And thus much coneerning the
extent of this benefit.

Observe then, Since such is the efficacy of the blood of
Christ to establish peace between God and men, we must
earnestly labour that we may obtain an interest in the
blood of Christ, and partake of that peace which passeth
all understanding. The only means of applying to our-
selves this quickening and saving blood of Christ, is true
faith3 Beingjustffied by saith, we have peace, Rom. v. l. Let
us seek faith from God, that laying hold on the blood of
Christ, thereby, that blood may bring peace to our con-
solences.
