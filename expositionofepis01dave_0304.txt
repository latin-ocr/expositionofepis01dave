called out .· And this calling is effected by the ministry of
the Gospel, and other means which God has appointed for
bringing men out of a state of ignorance and misery, and
leading them to a state of glory. In this sense we call any
assembly of men whatever, professing the doctrine and re-
ligion of Christ under legitimate pastors, a church. Such
were those seven churches to which John sent his Apoca-
lypse3 such the Roman, Corinthian, Colossian, and all
other visible and local churches. These assemblies are
called churches, and those who live in them are members
of those churches, and are to be regarded, in the judgment
of charity, as members of the Holy Catholic Church, as
well because those means are offered to them on God’s
part, by which men are called to the participation of eter-
nal life3 as because on their part, in outward act and pro-
fession, those means are received and employed for salva-
tion.

This external vocation through the proffered grace of the
Gospel, and this external adoption and profession of Chris-
tianity under legitimate pastors‚ constitutes the outward
and visible Church; and the professors of it are visible
members of the Church. But there is also another more
effectual vocation joined to this externa} one, in some per-
sons, namely, by grace implanted and impressed through
the power of the spirit in the hearts of the called3 by
means of which they not only enter upon the external pro-
fession of Christianity, but are joined to Christ himself by
the internal bonds of saith and the Spirit: Many are called,
butfew clzosen, says the Saviour.

These things being settled and allowed by the opinions
of all, as well Papists as of our own communion, we come
to what is before us, and comprise our opinion in this pro-
position;—The Catholic Church, which is called the body
of Christ, consists of such as are truly sanctified‚ and
united to Christ by an internal alliance3 so that no wicked
person, or unbeliever, is a member of this body, solely by
the external profession of saith, and participation of the
sacraments. We oppose this position to' Bellarmin‚ who,
