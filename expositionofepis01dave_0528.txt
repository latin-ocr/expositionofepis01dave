442 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAUL²S Clmp. ii.

tism as to the body of sin, because we are endowed with
this benefit obtained through the death of Christ: and
thence it comes to pass that our sins are not imputed to
us, but are accounted as dead and buried.

2. Not only in the person of our Head, but even in our
ownselves our sins are said to be buried in baptism z be-
cause that mortification and burial of sin is not only per-
formed sacramentally in one moment in the act of bap-
tism3 but really also is carried on by the spirit of grace
received in baptism, through the whole life of a Christian.
For the case of bodily death and burial is different from
that which is spiritual. The former hath no degrees, be-
cause it is pure privati0n3 he, therefore, who is dead, can-
not daily die more and more. But the latter is in process,
not in act past: therefore it hath degrees, so that he who
is dead to sin, may die more 3 he who is buried may be bu-
ried more, inasmuch as the work itself is to be perfected
in man, although as to the sacramental representation and
sealing of it it wanted nothing.

Ye are also risen] This is the second effect of baptism,
which is shadowed forth when the baptized person, after
immersion in the water, is drawn out of it, But the Apos-
tle, under this word resurrection, comprehends that new
life which the regenerate began to live after they were dead
and buried with Christ. And Ι call it new, because it hath
both a new beginning, and new niotions, or operations.
The new beginning is not a soul living, but a spirit sancti-
fying3 not desire innate, but grace imparted. The new
fruits are, not those works of tlzesteslz, Gal. v. 19, διο. adul-
ter-ies, strifeS, enayings, murders‚ drunlcemzess, and tlze lz'ke;
but love, joy, peace, gentlene.55‚ goodnesS,faith, &Q These
two benefits are always linked and joined together. For
as Christ himself did not abide in death, but rose again3
so, by virtue of his death and resurrection, we not only die
to sin, but also so rise again, that we live unio righteousness,
l Pet. ii. 24. Thus it is in Rom. vi. 5, If we have been
planted together witlz lzz'm in the likeness of lzz's death, we shall
be also in the likeness of lzis resurrection.

Hence we may infer,
