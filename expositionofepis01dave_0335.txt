Ver.2l. EPISTLE To THE cotossmns. 249

for the benefit of deliverance. First he says that they were
alienated. From whom? From God, from Christ, from the
Chureh, from all hope of obtaining salvation. For this
was the, condition of the Gentiles whilst they sat in the
darkness of nature, void of the grace of the gospel3 as
the Apostle fully shews, Ephes. ii. ll, 12, Remember that
με, when με were Gentiles, were without Christ, aliens from
the commonwealth of lsrael, strangers to the covenants ospro-
mise, having no hope, and without God in the world. This is
the misery of those that are alienated. Such were the Co-
lossians; such all the heathen before they were illumi-
nated by the Gospel.

Observe, 1. Clemens Alexandrinus, therefore, has grie-
vonsly erred, who writes, that the heathen, -by virtue of
their philosophy, may please God and obtain salvation,
Strom. 6.>χ< Augustine more truly says, that salvation is to
be granted to ηο one but him to whom the one Mediator between
God and man, Christ Jesus, hath been revealed from heaven.
De Civit. 18. 47. Why is salvation granted to no one with-
out this? ‘Verily because he remains alienated.

2. Certain also of the Papists are deceived, who talk
about merit of congruily, such as they suppose may be
found in persons who are not in a state of grace. But who-
ever is alienated fron] God and Christ, merits nothing either
of condignity or congruity, but the wrath of God and hell :
For by nature we are the children of wrath.

Lastly, we must observe, that the Apostle says of tho

“ The Translator 1135 often been perplexed‚ in the progress of his under-
taking, by the contradictory opinions of Divines and Historians relative to
the Fathers; and it has eost him much toil and painful investigation to trace
out the truth. In reference to the work of Clemens here alluded to, Dr.
A. Clarke, in his “ Succession of sacred Literature‚ vol. i. p. 125‚” most
highly extols it, representing Clemens as describing in it the true Christian ;
and asserting that ⁶⁴ the whole book is worthy of serious regam, as it points
out the pure manners of the Christians who lived in the second century.'’
It is possible Dr. Clarke may thus speak from a consideration of the facts
which the book contains, and Davenant with reference to the doctrines.
But it is not often that such a favourable view os differences of opinion can
be entertained3 too Frequently they appear to have arisen from envy and
party feeling, and to have been sustained by the malignant passionis of pre-
judice and bigotw.
