Ver.11. EmsTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 141

cal. · That which is philosophical‚ (such as is celebrated in
the instance of Socrates) had not this spiritualjoy united
with it3 that which is hypocritical hath inward repining:
that alone which is Christian possesses joy and spiritual
cheerfulness in the midst of calamities. They departedfrom
the presenceqf the conncz‘l, rejoicing that they were courzted
worthy to suff'er shame for his name. Acts v. 41.

But an objection is raised from the passage before ad-
duced‚ viz. Ye shall lament, but the world shall rejoiee .· there-
fore the afflictions of the godly (it is said) do not produce
gladness, but grief and tears. That opinion of the Philo-
sopher in his Ethics‚ (Ethic 3) is also well known, That
fortitude is occupied about a troublesonie and unpleasant
object, and therefore it is sufficient if a brave man be not
sad, although he may not be joyful.

I answer, This gladness is not concerning the object of
patience, for that inflicts pain3 but concerning the act,
the advantage, and the end 3 for the consideration of these
produces gladness. To rejoice concerning an object is not
suitable to every virtue3 for there is some kind of virtue to
which it pertains to grieve about its object, viz. penitence :
but to rejoice concerning its own act pertains to every
virtue ; because to every one endued with virtue, it is de-
lightful to exercise himself according to the habit of that
virtue. Whence even the penitent himself rejoices‚ though
it be at his own sorrow ε so the brave and patient are made
joyful by the very exercise of fortitude and patience, al-
though from the objects of these virtues they feel grief and
pain.

But this joyfulness, which arises from the consideration
of its own virtuous and praiseworthy employ, is not that
which the Apostle chiefly regarded 3 but rather that which
arises from confidence of the divine love; from a sure
knowledge that all our ‘affiictions work together for the
good of our souls; from the certainty of deliverance, and
the hope of glory. For so says the Apostle, All things
work together for good to them that love God, Rom. viii. 28.
And in the Epistle to the Philip. i. 28, In nothing terrffied
by your adversaries ; which is to them αη. evident tolcen cfper-
