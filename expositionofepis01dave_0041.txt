DAVENANT'S elevation to the Episcopate. was the necessary re-
sult of his Theological eminence. “ He had,'' says his animated
eulogist, Dr. Hacket, “ been public reader in Divinity in Cam-
bridge, and had adorned that place with such learning as no Pro-
fessor in Europe did better deserve to receive the labourer's penny
at the twelfth hour of the day.” Accordingly in 1621, he was
nominated to the See of Salisbury, vacant by the premature de- ’
cease of his brother-in-law, Dr. Robert Townson, who is said to
have been a man of singular piety, eloquence, and humility; and
who died a few months after his consecration‚ leaving a large fa-
mily of fifteen children, and being the fourth Bishop of that
D10cese who had been cut off in the space of seven years. It was
probably on account of the domestic burthen that thus devolved
upon him, rather than from his merit, that our Bishop was excused
the payment of the introductory sees, and of the annual pension,
which was then, it seems, customarily paid to the crown on all
similar appointments, proportionate to the wealth or poverty of the
individualz* and when introduced to the King, his Majesty en-
joined him not to marry.

But though elected in July, his consecration was delayed by an
unhappy event, which befel the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr.
Abbot3 who, as he was using a cross-bow in Lord Zouch’s park,
accidentally shot the keeper. Four Bishops-elect were then wait-
ing for consecration. Of these, Wilhams, elect of Lincoln, who,
as Heylin says, had an eye to the Primacy in case it had been de—
clared vacant; and Laud, elect of St. David’s, who had a personal
liatred to Abbot, stated an insuperable aversion to being conse-
crated by a man whose hands were stained with blood.. Davenant
did notjoin in this unworthy cavil; but kept altogether aloof, lest
he should be thought to act from private feelings of obligation to
