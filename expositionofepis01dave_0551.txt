upon christiam, and, after the debt was paid and the guilt
expiated by Christ, to compel them to a public confession
of it, as though it yet remained due.

3. Lastly, it remains that we consider, How this hand-
writing in ordinances is made void; which is expressed in
these three forms of speaking, it is blotted ont, it is talcen
out <ff tlze way, it is nailed to llis crass,- By all which expres-
sions this ene thing is shewn, That by virtue of the pas-
sion of Christ dying upon the cross, the condemning force
of the moral law was taken away, and all the rites of the
ceremonial law were likewise abrogated. For the hand-

of the Al'mstle, Beingjustffiecl bysaitlz we have peace wiclz
God, But, truly, he cannot have peace who sees himself
overwhelmed with debt, and, moreover, entangled by a
bond: but as soon as any one takes hold of Christ by faith,
thenceforth this hand-writing is blotted out, and his con-
science enjoys a blessed peace. And Paul in the most
admirable manner hath provided for trembling consciences
by a certain beautiful gradation. For, not content with
