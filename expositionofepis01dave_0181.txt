sons concur-ring in the truth, strengthens the minds of the
faithful, and as it were reproaches unbelievers with their
infidelity. Whence that remark of Augustine, Whoever
now requires miracles to establish his failh, is in himself a
mighty miracle, who, in the midst qs α bellet-ing world, does not
himself believe. De Civitat. Dei. xxii. 8.

Lastly, the Apostle calls to mind the propagation of the
Gospel through the whole world, that the Colossians might
hence understand that those new doctrines of the Philoso-
phers and Seducers, which began to be sown in that
Church, were not a part of the GospeL because they were
not propagated by the Apostles through the whole world.
And with this same argument we disprove all the errors of
the Papists: For they can never prove either the supre-
mae-y of the Pope of Rome, or the infallibility of his au-.
thority‚ or the worship of inmges, or the sale of indulgences,
or any other dogma in which they differ from ns, to have
been preached through the whole world by the Apostles or
their coadj utors: Theirs‚ therefore, are not the decrees ofthe
GospeL but the silliest imagination oflying dreamers3 where-
fore the saith of Christians is not bound by them. Shrewd-
ly spake Tertullian, When we believe the Gospel we have 710
liking for any thing furthemfor this we first believe, that
there z's not any thing beyond it that we ought to believeft——So
much concerning the diffusion of the Gospel: Now of its
efficacy.

And hringethforthfruit] Here we must supply, ile allllee
world, as it doth in yozu we may also add, (what is found
in many copies), and increasetlz.

These first words, and bringethforthfruit, shew the effi-
cacy of the Gospel in producing faith, love, and holiness
in the hearts of them that hear; in regard to which, preach-
ing is aptly compared to sowing, and the word to seed,
which, cast into tlte ground, ‘bringethforthfruit, some a hun-
dredfold, some ,εἶα-ἴῃ, some therty, Matth. xiii.

³* From Tertullian's piece, ‘⁶ De praescriptione Hereticorum‚'' a tract in

which lie enumerates and censures the various heresies that had infested the
Christian Church.
