12 AN EXPOSITJON OF ST. PAUL’S Chap. i.

the Pontiffs are pressed with these clear reasons, they are
compelled to shuffle, and to attribute a sort of half and
mutilated apostolic authority to their Pope. So Bellar-
min, lib. ii. de Rom. Pont. cap. 12, says, Three things are
comprised in the Apostleslzz'p .· First, that a man be imme-
diately called and taught by God; and this he confesses
that his Romish Apostle hath not: Secondly‚ that he
should establish churches in those places where they never
were : Thirdly, that he should have the chief power over all
churches‚ and be the Ordinary of the whole Church: and
he says these two marks of the Apostleship do meet in the
Roman Pontiff. But Cajetan, in tract. 3, de Rom. Pont-
institut. confesses, [f we must spealc sbrmally and exactly,
Peter had no successor in lzz’s Apostleslzip more than the rest (ff
the Apostles .· but beyond this Apostleslzz'p lze was the ordinary
Pastor of tlze ‘tvlzole world: in tln's office of superentending tlze
universal Clzurch, llze Pope succeeds him, and sojczr his clzcze'r is
called Αροείοίὶεὲ)ἑ

But neither must we concede this to the defenders of
the Papacy. First, because God doth not set over the
Catholic Church any universal Bishop fortified with apos-
tolic authority, who may err, and draw those under him
into errors. With this argument Gregory checked the
pride of John of Constantinople. He says, Epist. lib. 4,
cap. 76, T lle Catlzolic Clzurclz must needs miscarry, when he
jolls who is called Universal.† But it is agreed amongst the

⁸ Cajetan; otherwise Thomas de Vio, of Gaeta, another eminent de-
fender of the Papacy, who flourished prior to Bellarmin. Besides the work
above-mentioned, he wrote notes on Aristotle and Aquinas, and andExposi-¹
tion on almost all the Books of the Old and New Testament, which Mo-
sheim describes as brief and judicious. Though an amiable man, he enter-
tained such lofty ideas of papal authority, that in his efforts to reclaim Lu-
ther, he became a strenuous opposer of that Reformer; and in his proceed-
ings both greatly lost his temper, and threw a cloud over his other excel-
lencies. He was made a Cardinal, and afterwards Archbishop of Palermo ;
and accounted by Papists the oracle of his day.

† The well-known letter in which this sentence was given by Pope Gre-
gory, commonly styled the Great, may be found at the end of all the com-
plete copies of ssrent's Translation of F. Paul's History of the Council of
Trent. It must be admitted, that, viewed with reference to his character,
there appears as much of personal ambition as of piety in this famous Epis-
