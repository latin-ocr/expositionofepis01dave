292 AN EXPOSI'I'ioN oF ST. PAUL’S ‘'MP-‘3'-

pel; viz. that it was composed and eheerful3 and for which
he assigned two reasons. The former derived from his con-
formity with Christ3 Ifill up in my body that which remains
of tlze sufferings of Christ ; i. e. by sufferingl am made like
unto Christ: therefore I rqjoice in those things thclz Istffir.
The other reason is derived from the benefits accruing to
the Church by his sufferings, I endure afflictionsfor lais body
the Clzurclz; therefore Ι must and will rejoice in these my
sufferings. Now in this verse 25, he adds a third reason
why he should be so ready and willing to bear any thing
whatever for the Church ; and it is derived from the nature
of his office, I am made α minister of the Cle-ureb by God’s
ordinance,· therefore, so long as I can be of use to the
Church, I ought to rejoice in my afflictions.

In explanation of this verse there. are four points to be
considered ε

l. The office itself to which Paul was appointed, de-
scribed in these words, of which I am made a minister.

2. Who assigned this office to him3 viz. God himself:
he was appointed, κατα τῆν οικονομίαν Θεέ, according to tlze dis-
peusation or arrangement qf' God.

3. Those whom this office of Paul regarded3 viz. the
Gentiles, and amongst them the Colossians3 it is given to
mesor you, διο.

4. What was the scope and purpose of this appoint-
ment, vizv tofetlfil the word (ff God.

Of wlziclc Church l am made a minister] Minister, or
διακονος, is sometimes a general term, designating any per-
son discharging any office3 sometimes a particular one,
restricted to those who had the care of the revenue of the
Church and ofthe poor committed to them ; such were those
seven who were set over that business, Acts vi. 3.

were designed to release them from this Debt.''—Nothing but conviction of
the fact, which it is puerile to dissemble‚ could have wrung this unwilling
testimony from so bigotted a writer. And it may be inferred from his own
statement, and on his own principles, that if no such Indulgences had ex-
isted hitherto, it is high time they were established, particularly in hereti-
cal England.
