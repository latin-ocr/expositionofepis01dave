LxFE OF BISllOP DAVENANT. XlVll

reverend, learned, humble, and pious Primate of lreland, Abp.
Usher, then living at the Earl of Peterborough’s house. in St.
Martin's-lane. Sometimes he came to me, and oft l went to him.
And Dr Kendal, who had wrote pettishly against me, about
Universal Redemption and the specification of Divine grace, de-
sired me (when I had answered one of his invectives, and had
written part of the answer to the other), to meet him at Bishop
Usher's lodgings, and refer the matter to him for our reconcilia-
tion and future silence3 which I willingly did. And when the
Bishop had declared his judgment for that doctrine of Universal
Redemption which I asserted, and gloried that he was the man
who brought Bishop Davenant and Dr. Preston to it, he persuaded
us, who were both wilhng, to silence for the time to come.’'
(P. 205.) In the same book, referring to the same conference‚ he
delivers the opinion more fully: “ In my book called R. Bss
Judgment about the Perseverance of Βείίευενε, Ι shewed the va-
riety of opinions about Perseverance‚ and that Augustin and
Prosper themselves did not hold the certain perseverance of all
the elect; but held that there are more sanctified than are elect,
and that perseverance is affixed to the elect as such, and not to
the sanctified as such; which Bp. Usher averred to Dr. Kendal,
before my face, to be most certainly Austin's judgment, though
both he and Ι did incline to another. From hence, and many
other arguments, I inferred that the sharp censures of men against
their brethren‚ for not holding a point which Austin himself was
against, and no one author can be proved to hold from the Apos-
tles' days till long after Austin‚ doth argue less of judgment and
charity than many of the censurers seem to have.''

Upon atopic so important, a few observations may be made.
That Usher became less partial to the strict points of Calvinism
in later life, rests upon evidence too distinct to be questioned;
and Mr. Todd, in his life of Bp. Walton, has given some interest-
ing letters on the subject. Nevertheless, so early as 1617, when
yet a private divine, he maintained Universal Redempffion, and
his correspondence contains two powerful letters on the subject,
But, perhaps, he would not then have so fully allowed what he
afterwards maintained in one of his last conversations, when,
having preached what he called ‘⁴ a soul-saving sermon,” upon
the words “ Whom lze called, them lzeJ'ustffied,'' and being asked
by Walton, whether “ God, with his word, doth give internal
grace to all that are called by it, that they may repent if they
