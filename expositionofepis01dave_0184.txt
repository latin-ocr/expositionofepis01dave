under the Heathen emperors, yet, for all that, it was not
even impaired by so many calamities: but as Augustine
writes, Epis. 42, The Gentiles, and their idolatries, are over-
come, not by the opposition, bui by the death qf the Christiana*

In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke in many places takes
care to record this increase of the Christian Church, as a
proof of the Divine protection and the power of the Gospel.
Thus, ch.v. 14, The multitude of them that believed increas-
ed; and xvi. 5, The charches were established, (md increased in
numbers daily. It is no sign of Evangelical truth for its
professors to propagate their Religion by arnis (as the Ma-
hometans do), or by fire and fraud (as the Papists); but
when by preaching, or by patience, Religion prevails against
those who oppose it, this is a strong argument that Divine
assistance is present with its ministers. We have a clear
evidence of this in the restoration of the Gospel through
Luther and other pious nien, in that it increased daily,
whilst the Pope was gnashing liis teeth, and the kings
of the earth raging—So far in regard to the diffusion and
efficacy of the Gospel.

mode of preaching.

The efficacy of the Gospel is magnified from the circum-

and it continues still to work: Here is double praise be-

* It was the unparalleled patience of the Christians under sufferings3
the improbability that men addicted to vice should submit to the loss of all
that is desirable, and deliver themselves voluntarily to the executionem
which first awakened the curiosity of the philosophie Justin; such the first
reasoning which led him to embrace a Religion, for the professors of which
he became such an apologist as we have lately seen, and of which he himself
became subsequently a B‘Iartyr. The translator dwells upon these points as
facts calculated to meet the scepticism and libertinism of the present day.—
