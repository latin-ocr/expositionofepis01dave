244 AN EXPOSITloN or s'r. PAuL's Chap. i.

Because by being lifted up at his death, 116 seemed to
prepare an ascent for us into heaven.

Because being stretched upon the cross, he seemed to
call the whole world to loolcsor salvation hidden in him.

Because, by his blood running down upon the earth, he
would not only purify the earth3 but also by his body

This, and much more of the same kind, occurs in Aqui-

to heavenly things ‘l‘ for where there is no sin, where there
is no breach, there needs no reconciliation.

Chrysostom expounds this passage of the angels3 whom
he states to have been our enemies by reason of the fall
and rebellion of man against God their Lord, but to have
been made friends and well-disposed towards us after we
