64 AN Exposl'rloN OF ST. PAUL’S Chapi.

remission of sins, he is opposed to St. Paul. who, in a
hundred places, names Christ as the principal object of
saith, not the word in general : he also opposes even Aqui-
nas, who says, thatfaitlz in the act ofjastifying does not
even regard and contemplate all the articles qf'faitlt alike,
much less the whole word qf' God, but only God as 7emz'tling
sins.—But here a doubt which is raised by the Schoolmen
may be briefly solved.

They ask, How Christ can be the object of faith‚ when
saith has for its object an enunciation or proposition re-
vealed by God? Christ is a thing, and (as the Logicians
say) an incomplex term, not a proposition in which truth
or falsehood is perceived.

It is answered, That is called an object of saith which is
either believed itself, or concerning which any thing is be·-
lieved. The thing itself which is believed is a proposition
or enunciation3 that concerning which it is believed is a
thing signified by a simple term, as Durandus says. Aqui·-
nas more plainly remarks 3 The object of saith is regarded
in a twofold manner: either on the part of the thing be-
lieved ; and so the object of saith is always something in-
complex, viz. the thing itself concerning which the pro-
positions of faith are formed, as Christ, the resurrection,
the final judgment, creation, and the like: or on the part
of the person believing; and so the object of faith is that
enunciation which saith apprehends concerning the thing,
as that Christis the Mediator and Saviour, that our bodies
shall rise again, and that Christ will come to judge the
world, that God created the world, and the like.—-Thus far
concerning the first gift, i. e. faith, and its object, viz.

Chslilrszii love to all the saints] This is that other gift, from

which the Apostle has taken occasion to give thanks to
God in the name of the Colossian.s; and to which also is
joined a certain special object of this virtue, viz. the saints.

Respecting this gift itself we must first enquire what it
is. Lombard* thought (lib. i. dist. 4), that love was

tences. He was born at Novara, in Lombardy, but brought up at Paris,
in the University of which place he distinguished himself so much, that he
