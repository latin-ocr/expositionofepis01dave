God ε for we are by nature che children of wratlz, Ephes. ii.
3. Death, therefore (as you see) hath seized upon us all;
spiritual death, actually3 eternal death, by sentence3 and
in each‘ respect we are justly said to be altogether undone.

In sins] i. e. In actual transgressions of the Divine law :
This is one, and a clear cause of our death. For the wages
of sinis death by the Divine ordination. The soul that sin-
vecla z't shall die; tlte deallz (gf grace, inasmuch as sin, by its
impurity, dissolves that gracious union of the soul to God,
in which our spiritual life consists3 according to that de-
claration of the prophet, Isa. lix. 2, Your iniquities have se-
parated between you and your· God, arzdyour sins kat-e hid leis

the Apostle, Ephes. ii. ll, 12. But I incline to their opi-
nion who take this word figuratively, and by uncircumcz'sion
of tliefleslz understand that original sin which is derived to
all by carnal propagation, and renders the very soul itself
as though it were carnal. For although this word may pro—
perly signify a particular part of the body, yet, figuratively,
it may be transferred to many other things z Sometimes it
denotes the Gentiles themselves, as circumcision does the
Jews, as in Rom. iii. 30, It is God whojustffies the circumci-
sion byfaitk, and tlze uncircumcisz'on through saith. Some-
times it denotes Heathenism, or the condition of the Gen-
