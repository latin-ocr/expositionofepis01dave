So much concerning the first property.

Faz‘thful] This is the second property wherewith the
Apostle dignifies the Colossians. Some would have this
title to be an explanation of the formem as though the
Apostle had said, We, by the law of charity, judge all
Christians holy3 but they alone are aoeounted saints before
God who are truly faithful: For God purifies the hearts of
men byfaitln Acts xv. 9. For although the sacraments are
not only signs representing, but also offering grace,† yet
unbelief spurns and repels the grace offered by God.
Hence that very remarkable saying of Augustine, leence
is there so much virtue in the water, that it should but touch
the body, and cleanse the heart, except by the word making ic
so: not Because it is spoken, but because it is believed? And
Tertullian reproves those who think that the ungodly and

thus occupied, the writer would also beg leave to commend in a similar
manner to general pel-usal, three volumes of ‘⁶ Essays on the Liturgy and
Collects'‘ of our Church, by the Rev. T. T. Biddulph, as suitably display-
ing the principles avowed by every baptized Churchman, and enforcing the
correspondent character and conduct that should, as a consequence, be
maintained and exhibited by all such. Indeed, for sterling divinity, and
Christian learning„ and for all the purposes of the Christian life and expe.
rience‚ as well as for admirable practical illustration of the most important
parts of our invaluable Liturgy⁷ those Essays cannot be equalled, whilst
they are written in a fervid and most elegant style.
