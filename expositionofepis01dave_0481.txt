rors, drawn sometimes by false consequences srom true
premises. Thus the Stoics, Epicuream, Aristoteliam, and
as many as come under the denominatim] of philosophers,
do not‘always teach the dictates of right reason, but the
dreanis of their own fancy. But, truly, if any one should
attempt, under the name of philosophy, to introduce these
errors into theology, he commits a double sin z first, inas-
much as he resolves the corruptions of philosophers into
the dogmas of philosophy itself3 next, because he even
thinks to subject theology to the rules of philosophy. And
the Fathers appear to me strictly to have reproved this
abuse in the antient heredes, and sometimes to have de-
claimed severely, on that account, against true philosophy
and philosophers. Nothing is more frequent in Tertulliani
A philosopher is the creature of boascing, They affert trueh, and
in qffecling it they mar it. Every heresy is engeuderecl by the
devices «ff philosophers. All heresies consist of the maxims <ff
philosophers. All the dogmas ‘ff heretics, when they growfrz'-
gid and stiff, and therefore cannot talce witzg, find α place qf
seulement and repose among the thorus of Aristotle. Nor is
Lactantius more mild towards them; for in Institut. lib. 3.
cap. 2, and in many subsequent places, he continually at·
tacks philosophy and philosophers. But, as Ι have said,
these respect not true and sober philosophy, keeping within
its bounds3 but that bold and deceitful counterf'eit, which
dares to mingle itself with things beyond its reach‚ or
which publishes the opinions of private nien for the de-
crees of truth itself. You perceive the abuse3 now let us
shew the use of true philosophy: And this is manifold.

1. The knowledge of philosophy is useful, nay, neces-
sary to the clear understanding and perspicuous elucidation
of many passages which every where occur in the sacred
Scriptores. For although the principles of our Religion
are derived from God, not from human reason, or any phi-
losophical science3 yet many forms of speaking occur in

the books of holy Scripture, many examples and illustra-
tions‚ which cannot fully be understood and stated with
perspicuity, without the aids of human literature. Of this
kind are those passages which speak of the motion, the
