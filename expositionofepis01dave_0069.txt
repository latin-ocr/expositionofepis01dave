which it compels. It is the opinion of Armachanusff* that is all
Bishops were dead, inferior priests could ordain. Certainly the
consideration is much ahke, when all have become sworn enemies
to the truth. For as a commonwealth, so a particular church‚
has a certain extraordinary power for the necessary preservation of
itself. If, then, certain Protestant churches‚ which could not
look for ordination from Popish Bishops, have, under this neces—
sity, ordained Presbyters, with the consentes their own Presby-
ters, they are not to be judged as having injured the episcopal
dignity‚ but to have yielded to the necessity of the Church.

The last token os episcopal dignity remains, which exalts them
above Presbyters, and allows them not by any means to be ac-
counted equal in degree. This is the power of jurisdiction, not
only over the laity, but over the Clergy‚ who are also, by Apos-
tolical institution, subject to Bishops. It is a saying as true as it ·
is common, Equal [ια-Νι not power over equal. But Bishops have
power over the Clergy; not, indeed, a reyal or lordly power, but
one that is Pastor-al, or Paternal; which is inconsistent with all
kind of parity or equality. 'l‘o say nothing of others, exeommu-
nication, which is the spiritual staff, is delivered into the Bishop's
hand, to chastise‚ not only the vicious or contumacions of the
laity, but also Presbyters that deserve this censure. This is most
evident from the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, of whom one was
constituted Bishop of the Church of Ephesus, and the other of
Crete, by St. Paul. They are commanded to enjoin some not to
preach diverse doctrines, to stop the mouths of deoeivers, to re-
ject heretics, and other points, implying jurisdiction and autho-
rity. It is also evident from the language of Christ to the angels
of the Asiatic Churches. The angel, (i. e. the Bish0p‚) of the
church of Pergamos is oeproved, (Rev. ii. 15) because he had in
his church some who held the doctrine of the Nicolaitans. Thus,
also, the angel of the church of Thyatira, (Rev. ii. 20) because
he permitted the woman jezebel to tenc-h and to seduce the peo-
ple. Therefore‚ in the judgment of Christ himself, the Bishop
hath authority to restrain and reject heretics out of the Church.
Ι do not say that a Bishop was accustomed to do this without the
counsel of Presbyters; for what Cyprian declares of hiniself,
(Epist. lib. 3. epist. 10‚) thatfrom the beyinniny of his Episco-
pate lze lead determined to do nothing of lais own private opinion
without advice, was probably observed by other pious Bishops.
