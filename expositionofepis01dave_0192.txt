106 ΑΝ EXPOSI'HON OF sT. PAUL’s Claapst.

riously think with himself3 viz. the Word of God, and the
Sacraments of Christ. Either to conceal the former, or in
any manner to adulterate it, is a gross impiety3 to cast the
latter before dogs or swine, or deny them to the children,
is the greatest sacrilege.

To whom all these things are to be administered, let him
consider in the last place 3—To the sheep of Christ, to His
brethren, to the children of God 3 to those whom Christ re-
deemed, not with silver and gold, but with liis precious blood.
He who shall lose even one poor soul of these by his un-
faithfulness, it were better for lzim if a millstone were lzanged
about liis neck, and he were cast into the sea, Luke xvii. 2.

But here it may be asked, Why in extolling Epaphras,
the Apostle should mention only his faithfulness, not his
wisdom3 when each is required in the dispensation of the
Divine word? as it is said in Matth. xxiv. 45, leo then is

teaches and shews what is required from a faithful man ;
for wisdom is the eye of every virtue.

Secondly‚ that by the way he might check those new
and false teachers in the church of the Colossians, who
affected a shew of wisdom, whilst at the same time, they
divested themselves of all regard for fidelity. He therefore
calls Epaphras a faithful minister of Christ, that he might
oppose him to those in whom an opinion of their own wis-
dom predominated‚ when, nevertheless, they were unfaith-
ful towards Christ.

For yom] After the Apostle had recommended Epa-
phras on the ground of his vocation itself, that he was α
minister of Christ; and on the ground of the character of
his ministry, that he was czjaic'hful minister he now adds
what greatly conduced to conciliate their love to him, sor
you, i. e. for your good, for your salvation.

From the design, therefore and end of the ministry, he
