In him dwelt] That is, in the man Christ, or in that
human nature in which he undertook and administered the
business of our salvation: In that human nature, I say, so
mean and despicable in the eyes of unbelieving men, all
the fulness of the Godhead dwelt and perpetually dwells3
Phil. ii. 6, 7. The Apostle employs this metaphorical
