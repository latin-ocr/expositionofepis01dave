Ver. 19. EPISTLE To THE coLossmNs. 231

there is a concurrence of all the gifts of grace. Besides,
whilst other men obtain grace in an inferior measure3
Christ not only possesses all grace, but also hath it in the
highest degree. Whence some say that this habitual and
infused ‘grace of Christ, may in some sense be termed in-
finite: viz. inasmuch as it is not limited in kind ordegree;
but contains in itself whatever falls under the term grace :
As if any one should say the light of the sun is infinite,
not as far as regards the essence of that attribute, but as
far as the nature of light alone is considered; because
whatever appertains to light is found in the solar light in
the highest degree. But this is an incorrect mode of
speaking. The. Scriptures every where affirm this fulness
of grace to be in Christ, John iii. 34, The Spirz't was given
to him without measure. In him are all tr'easures, Col„
ii. 3.

Ye see then that all fulness of grace is in Christ.

2. Now, in the second place, let us consider, Why it
was necessary this fulness of grace should be in Christ.
First, the fitness of things required it, on account of the
union of his soul to the Word. For it is just and proper
that in proportion as any thing is nearer to the influential
cause, so much the more abundantly should it partake of
the influence itself: Since, therefore, God himself is the
fountain of grace, the soul of Christ, so near to God, can-
not but abound in grace. Secondly, necessity requires it,
from consideration of the end, on account of the relation
of Christ himself to the human race. For grace was to be
bestowed on him not as on a private person, but as the uni-
versal fountain from whom it might be transfused into the
rest of rnen. But in this fountain all the parts ought to
be full and combined. The Evangelist shews that grace
is shed abroad in us from Christ, John i. 16, Of leis fulness
have all we received. And 'the Apostle, Ephes. iv. 7, To
every one “f us is given grace according to tlte measure cf tlte
gift (ff Clu-isc.

ὃ. It remains that we shew, in the last place, that this
fulness of grace is peculiar to Christ alone. To prove
