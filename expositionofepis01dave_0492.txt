406 AN EXPOSlTioN OF ΒΤ. PAUL’s Chap- ii.

churches might coalesce more easily with each other. But
it is proper to add that other point also, That the case was
not the same with all the legal ceremonies. For whereas
they are divided by the ancient Schoolmen into sacrifices,
sacraments, sacred thingS‚ and observances3 it was not
lawful after the passion of Christ to call in the aid of sa-
crifices for propitiating God, nor sacraments for spiritual
sanctification‚ nor those legal rites for the worship of God
without a Mediator3 but it was lawful for a time (especially
to Jews embracing the Christian religion) that they should
retain certain of these observances for this end, lest they
should give offence to their weak brethren, Acts xxi. 26.
Now then from these things which have been stated. we
may collect the difference between the Apostle’s retaining
certain legal institutions, and seducers urging the Mosaie
law. The Apostle did that from respect to the weak before
the Gospel was fully published3 the seducers urged it to
be done for a continuance: The Apostles allowed certain
things to be observed with freedom of conscience, for the
sake of charity, and of avoiding offence; the seducers re-
called the whole Mosaic law, and that as necessary to jus-
tification and salvation. Thus much may suffice respecting
these three forms of impostures3 viz. philosophical specu-
lations‚ human traditions‚ and legal rudiments.

And not aster Christ] In these last words is contained
the general reason why the three aforementioned doctrines
of the seducers are to be avoided and rejected3 viz. because
neither those curious speculations, nor those superstitious
traditions, nor those abrogated eeremonies, are after
Christ.

l. All these things are denied to be after Christ, be-
cause they are not ¹after the doctrine made known by Christ
himself, and his Apostles by the inspiration of the Spirit
of Christ.

Where we must observe, that this is the strongest of all
ways of concluding that this is not after Christ, i. e. not
made known in the Gospel of Christ, therefore not to be
admitted in the business of ourjustification and salvation.
