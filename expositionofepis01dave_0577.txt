i. e. ij they always leave the divine precepts z'n their mouth, διο.
When the law forbe'ds swine to be caten, it reproves a lffefiltley,
and polluted, cmd delightz'ng in tlze impurity os vice. Tertul-
lian makes these and many more such remarks. Theodoret
follows the same argument, quaest. ll, in Levit. and Au-
gustine embraces the whole matter in these few words, The
meats, says he, wlziclz tlze Jews avoided in cattle, it belzoves us
Ιο avoid in morals. More recent commentators think that
God had not respect to the particular properties of the ani-
mals in those prohibitions ; but rather wished to distinguish
the body of the Jewish Church by this ceremonial from the
Egyptian& Chaldeans, and all other nations. By these
rites, therefore, they publicly professed themselves to be
the peculial· people of God, both washed and sanctified‘3
whereas all other nations were deemed unclean. The vision
of St. Peter, and the application of it, contained in Acts
x. verses 11 and 23, favours this opinion. From which it

(which may fitly bc done) join them together, it is plain
that those distinctions of meats were only shadows of
things to come, which are made manifest to all by the Ad-
vent of Christ.

Now, as to lioly days, the argument is the same. For
although they were instituted as a. memorial of past bene-

ance from Egypt3 the feast of pentecost, in remembrance
of the benefit of the giving of the law; the feast of Taber-
nacles‚ in memory of the Divine protection in the wilder-
ness; the sabbath, in ineniory of the creation ; and so of
the rest: yet there was conjoined with them, a shadowing
forth and promise of the spiritual benefits to be exhibited
in Christ. The deliverance from Egypt, and the Passover
of the Jews, shadowed forth our deliveranee from the pow-
ers of hell, and the death of Christ: the feast of Pente⁴
cost, and that celebration of the giving of the law shadow-
cd forth the descent of the Holy spirit, and the writing of
