3. Why God, of whom Christ is the image, is called
invisible.

As respects the first point: in the consideration of cm
image there are these three particulars ε First‚ that what is
called an image must possess the likeness of some other
thing. For if no likeness subsist between them, it is ab·
surd and contrary to all reason to call it an image : for it
cannot represent the other; which is the peculiarity of an
image.

Secondly, it is required in an image, that that which is
properly understood by this term should be in some way
drawn and derived from that of which it is called the
image. For a. mere resemblance where there is no deduc-
tion or derivation of the one from the other, does not con-
stitute a proper character osan image: as, for example‚‘
we do not call milk the image of milk, or an egg the
image of another egg3 because the one is not derived from
the other.

Lasssy, it is required, that the likeness which exists be-
tween the image itself, and that of which it is the image,
should pertain to the specific nature of the prototype, as
far as to its participation in, or, at least, its designation
of the species. When it pertains to the very nature of the
species, it is called an essential and natural image, or an
image of equality: when it extends only to the outward
designation of the species, it is called an accidental or ar-
tificial image, or an image of imitation. In the former
way, the image of a king is said to be in the prince his
son : In the second, the image of a king is said to be im-
pressed upon his coin, or painted on a picture. Having
laid down these principles, let us now enquire, What sort
of an image of God Christ our Redeemer is, or in what
sense he is called the image-(ff God.

And here a twofold consideration occurs. For Christ is
to be regarded either as he was the eternal and invisible
image of the Father before the foundation of the world, or
as 116 was the visible and manifest image of the invisible
Father, viz. after the assumption of the flesh.
