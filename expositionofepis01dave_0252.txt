itself to glory.

Secondly, they are not fully redeemed from these bodily
afflictions, neither from the remains of sin, that they may

as ajustjudge, may confer upon them, aster having well
fought this fight, the unfading crown.

Lastly, he would not straightway deliver the faithful from

man have been accomplished: for by no exchange of any
creature could the reproach brought upon God by man be
compensated.

3. By violent abduction: as when David by force of
