be said to be capable. Thirdly, let us assume the omni-
science of Christ to be proved from this passage, yet. they
will not immediately make out from this that that is in the
soul or human nature of Christ: for the Apostle does not
say, in which soul, or nature3 but in whom. i. e. Christ, are
all treasures: they are, therefore, in Christ, because in the
Word, not because in the human nature. So Ambrose
places the treasures of omniscience in the person of Christ,
not in the human nature ε he says, it is just that tlze know-
ledge of all things should be in the Author of all things. But
the Word, not the human nature of Christ, created all
things. So Aquinas in his Commentaries refers this omni·
science to the Word, not to the soul: leatever, says he,
can be known concerning God‚ all THAT llle Word has abun-
dant knowledge of in himsef; whatever can be known concern-
ing tlze creature, he lrnows pre-eminently in lzimseff: and there-
fore in the Worcl are affl treasures.

We have thus vindicated this passage from the cavils of
the Ubiquitarians: We shall now refute their error by a
few arguments3 and that from their own principles.

l. They concede that each nature in Christ possesses
and retains its own properties, so that the property of one
nature can never become the property of the other: thus
James Andreas, Colloq. Monipelg.ss But what is really
communicated to one, that becomes the property of the
other : Omniscience, therefore, being really communicated
to the human nature of Christ, does not remain the pro-
perty of the Divine nature alone ς because it is found in the
other nature.

2. The attributes of the Divine nature are not commu-
nicated essentially to the human nature ; for were this the case,

’⁵ Andreas; was a celebrated Lutheran Divine of VVirtemberg, eminent
as a Reformer, and distinguished by the part he took in the controversies of
his day3 being engaged in the public conferences at Worms, Ratisbon, Augs-
berg, .Meming‚ Torgau, ἃς. The work above referred to is the discussions
at Mompelgard, with Beza, concerning the Lord’s supper, the person of
Christ, predestination, &c. He was Chancellor to Gustavus Vasa, and
employed by that Monarch to translate the Scriptures into the Swedish
Language. He died in 1590, strong in the saith, which, through an active
life, he had laboured to maintain and defend.
