Ver-‚28 EPISTLE TO THE cotossmns. 319

put α good mind into a matu which is effected, not only by
warning, but by rebuking, comforting, and many other
means. Labour, therefore, and attention of every descrip-
tion in- a Minister, which is calculated to regulate the af-
fections, and is found practically conducive to that effect,
so that the doctrine of salvatiou may take deep root in
men’s hearts, is included under the term νουθεσιαν. VVhether,
therefore, we would correct the transgressor, or rouse the
negligent, or cheer the desponding', or in short, work upon
the will and the affections in any manner, all is included in
this first part of a Minister's duty, viz. νουθέτησιν Where-
fore Clemens, Paedag. lib. 1. cap. 8, says, that νουθετησις is
the prescribed dietsor α diseased sont, connselling z‘t to take
what is salutaris, and cantioning it against what is z'ty‘ztrz’ous.
This part, therefore, of the ministerial office, is chiefly
conversant with the reformation of the morals of men:
Nor is it to be despised on the ground of the topics being
common and ordinary which are urged by ministers in their
exhortations and rebukes. For Seneca wisely observes,
What is the nse ofslzewing that which is evident? Muclz every
way. For sometimes we know but pay no attention. Admoni—
tion teacltes not: bnt it warns, it excites, it keeps tlte memory
alive, it prevenis tlte thingfrom gliding out ossiglzt. We pass
by many olqy'ects that are bffin‘e our eyes ; to admom‘slz z‘s α lcind
of advice. lee mind osten neglects what is plain before it,-
therefore tlze notice os things most notorious must be suggested
to z't. Serico. Epist. lib. 14. Epist. 94.

Another part of Gospel preaching· is observable in teach·
ing. But διδασκειν, to teach, relates to the understanding‚ as
νουθετέιν, to worn, does to tlze wilt and cgffections. It is, there-
fore, a Minister’s duty not only to correct depraved affec-
tions and bad 1norals, but also to enlighten the blind un-
derstanding. He ought to* be both like salt, to dry up the
corrupt. humours of the affections3 and like light, to dispel
the darkness of the mind ε the one is done by warning and
rebuking ς the other by teaching and instructing.

The doctrine itself also is twofold3 viz. of tlte law, and
of grace: and it belongs to the ministerial office to explain
each, and to bring forward all those passages of Scripture
