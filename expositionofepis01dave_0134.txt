48 AN ExPOSITJON OF ST. PAUL’S Clzap. i.

these gifts3 but that every one who is indeed possessed of
them, knows also that he truly believes, and is in favour
with God, &m The Jesuit concludes affirmatively from
the Major to the Minor, in this manner: An heretic and
carnal man is deceived, in judging concerning saith and
grace3 therefore the truly faithful and renewed man may
also be deceived. Like as a man is deceived, who in a dream
thinks not that delusions but realities are presented to his
mind, yet it follows not from thence that he is, or can be
deceived, when he is satisfied that he is not asleep‚ but

not proper to believe it.

The conclusion is utterly invalid; however I shall not
stop to repel it; butI answer, that the article is laid down
in all creeds. First, by evident consequence. For when Ι
say, [believe in God, (as Augustine, and after him all the
Schoolmen have it), Ι say not only that I believe that there
is a God, or that I believe his words3 but that I myself
love kim, and through believz‘ng in God go to him, and am in-
