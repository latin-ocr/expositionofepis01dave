402 AN EXPOSlTlON or ετ. PAUL'S Chap. ii,

God, is 3 disturber of public order, and a despiser of the
power ordained of God. But here it is fit to add certain
cautious.

1. That men should not prescribe any rites or external
works with the design of obtaining by them righteousness,
the remission of sins, or acceptance with God without a
Mediator: for, as to what pertains to all these matters,
Christ is sufficient, nor does he require any additions of
human invention. Traditions of this kind (and such are
almost all those of the Papists) are overthrown by that de-
nunciation of the Apostle, Gal. v. 4, leosoever (ffyou are
justified by the law (με are fallen from Christ. How much
more are they fallen from Christ, who seek justification and
salvation in human commands? Prosper hath well decided
concerning these observances: Fastings, abstinences‚ vigils,
almsdeeds, and other things of' llzis kind, are not to be offered
for riglzteousness‚ but witlz rigltleonsness to God, De vita con-
templ. lib. 3. cap. 10.

2. We should take care that these traditions concerning·
things indifferent in their nature, should not be so enjoined
as to bind the conscience equally with the laws of God;
i. e. so that this gnilt of condeinnation should be incurred
by any violation of them, although that should happen
without contempt of those who enforce them, or scandal
to any. WVisely and truly says Gerson, part. 3, They abuse
their power wlzo wislt tlzat all cheir ordinances should have their
validity under che sanction of eternal punishment. And part.
1. in conclus. Matth. Grabb. leat every one wlzo does any
tlzing contrary to tlte canonical injunctions sins mortally, is in
error.

3. We should take care lest traditions concerning things
indifferent should be so multiplied as thereby to impose a
servile yoke upon Christians, and bring them again, as it
were, under 3 Jewish bondage. For this the Apostles
themselves carefully avoided, Acts xv. 10, ΠῘΙςῃ tempe ye
God to put a yolee upon the neck qs tlze disciples, which neither
ourfathers nor we were able to bear? Augustine‚ Epist. 119,
says, this exuberant abnndance of ceremonies is to be retrench-
ed, because tlzey load Religion witlz servile burdens. And rea-
son necessarily requires that. For this superfluous occu-
