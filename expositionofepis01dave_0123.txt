Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE conossrANs. 37

troversy between us and the Papists, which we shall briefly
touch upon. The Apostle, as you have heard, desires for
the faithful grace and peace from God, and from the Lord
Jesus Ohrz'st ; i. e. gratuitous acceptance for Christ’s sake,
adoption among the children of God, and assurance of the
remission of sins : Hence it is enquired Whether the faith-
ful can or cannot assuredly determine with themselves that
they are in favour with God, and that their sins are remit-
ted them for Christ's sake, in whom they have believed?

Our opinion is that every faithful and truly justified
man may, and ought, infallibly to believes* that his sins are
remitted to him as an individual, and that God is recon-
ciled to him3 i. e. that he hath this grace aad peace, which
the Apostle desired for the Colossians. .

The opinion of the Papists is, That they who are truly
justified and in favour with God, yet neither can nor ought
to believe that they are reconciled to God and justified3
but to hope and conjecture only that they are in a state of
grace, and have obtained remissiori.

We establish our opinion by these arguments :

l. From the nature of saith. He who is endued with
true faith sees, by the very light of that faith kindled in
his heart through the Holy Spirit‚ that he believes in Christ,
and is justified by saith: but he who sees this, at the same
time is able to conclude that he 18 in favour with God, and
that his sins are remitted him. For Scripture plainly states,
Beingjastffied bysaich we have peace, Rom. v. l. He that
believetlz on the Son hath everlasting life, John iii. 16 and 36.
Therefore the whole difficulty lies in this, To shew that a
believer is authorised to say, not from conjecture and opin-
ion, but from conviction, I believe in Christ. This is
proved from Augustine, De Trin. xiii. l, Thac which we are
commanded to believe we are ‘not able to see ; yet faith itself
when it is wrought in us, we know to be in us. So Thomas,
Whosoever hath knowledge or saith, z's sure that he hath it,-

¹² An expression corresponding to this opinion in one of the Collects of
our Church is ‘⁶ perfectly and without all doubt.'’ Vide Collect for Saint
Thomas's day, a striking and godly prayer, that, as Churchmen, it may be
even so with us.
