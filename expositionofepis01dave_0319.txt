Ver.20. EPISTLE To THE coLossmNs. 233

administration of which they are altogether incompetent,
are not called to them by God, but are impelled either by
avarice or ambition.

2. For any one to be accounted the head of the Church,
he must-necessarily have afulness of grace. In whom this
falness is wanting, it is well with him if he be numbered
among the members of the Church; he cannot assume to
himself the name and the honour of head without the great-
est arrogance or folly, as Gregory hath shewn, Epist. lib.
i. epist. 82.

3. Since there is afulness of grace in Christ alone, we
must expect its streams to flow to us from him alone ε they
who seek grace elsewhere commit two evils ; they forscdce the
fountain os living waters, and lzew them out cister-ns, broken
cisterus that can hold no water, Jer. ii. 13. 1

And now we have gone through the description ofChrist
our Redeemer.

Verse 20.
And, having made peace through Ihe blood of his cross, by
him to reconcile all things unco himself; by him, I say,
whether they he things in earth, or things in heaven.

Our Apostle has, up to this point, been occupied in ex-
plaining the doctrine of Redemption. The blessing of
redemption itself he has slightly glanced at in verses 12,
13, 14. From that l4th verse to this place, he has de-
scribed the Redeemer, and dignified him with various titles.
Here, in this verse, and the two following, he again re-
turns to the subject of redemption, and more copiously
expounds the mode of it, having before but briefly touched
upon that topic. But of the work of redemption, or re-
conciliation, he speaks first, generally, as far as it relates
to all, in this verse: then, in the two following, specially,
as far as it pertains to the Colossians themselves.
