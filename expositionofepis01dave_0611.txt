Pharisees, having heard this discourse, were offended,
Christ confirmed his opinion from the very condition and
corruptible nature of all meats3 Do με not yet understand,

he had said, It is foolish to seek holiness or righteousness
in those frail, earthly, and corruptible things, or to sear
any pollution and contamination of sin from them: for all
things of this kind are neither good nor evil in themselves,
but are to men just as are the minds of those who use
them. This, then, is the sentence of Christ himself con-
cerning meats. ,Moreoveiu Paul, not only in this place but
many others, invalidates their opinion, who thought that
some religion consisted in a difference of meats 3 and, for
the most part, he uses this very argument, taken from
their earthly and corruptible nature. Thus, l Cor. vi. 13,
Meals are intended for the bell-y, and the bellyfor meals,· but
God shall destroy both it and them. lle does not say that
ments are intended sor sanctifying the mind3 but for filling
the belly. And Rom. xiv. 17, 18 (which passage we have
before cited), The kingdom (f God is· not meat and dre'nk, buc
righteousness, peace, and-joy in the Holy Glzost .’ For he tlzat

fore, who imagines that he serves Christ, inasmuch as he
abstains from certain kinds of meats, or because he binds
himself to the observance of certain rites as to external
things, deceives himself. neither does he on these accounts
become more acceptable to God ς but if he cherishes peace
and righteousness in the Holy Spirit, then he will at length
be acceptable to God. Well spake Prosper, De vit. con-
templ. 3. 10, Fusae, abstinences, and other things (ff tlzis kind,
are not to be ‹ffered to God for riglzteousness, buc with righ-
teousness. If, then, there is no righteousness in fasting,
how much less in abstaining from this or that sort of meat,
when, meanwhile, other meats are taken, and that perhaps
with no very strict moderatiori?
