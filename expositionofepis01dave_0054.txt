Monumentorum omnium
JOHANNIS DAVENANTII
Minime perenne, quid loquatur audi.
Natus Londini Anno Christi 1572 Maii die 20
Cantabrigiae in Colle-gio Reginali
bonis literis opeam fzelicem dedit,

Cujus cum Societate esset meritissime donatus
AEtatemq. et doctrinae et morum gravitate superaret,
Cum nondum plures quam 36 annos numerasset,

D. M'argaretae in S. Theologia Professsr est electus
Celebremque prius Cathedram longe ornatiorem reddidit.
Intra quadriennium mox Collegii sui praesidens fectus est
Cui dubium Rector an Benefactor profuerit magis
Tum vero a serenissimo et in rebus 'l'heologicis
Perspicacissimo Rege, Jacobo, honorifice missus
Synodo Dordracensi magna pars interfuit,
Tandem hujusce Diocaeseos Saribns- Episcopus
Anno 1621 die Novembris vni* consecratus est.

Cui velut vivum exemplar antiquitatis venerandae
Universas Primitivi Praesulis partes explevit
Atque ita per 20 pene annos huic Ecclesiae praefuit
Summo tum bonorum omnium tum etiam hostium,
Consensu optimus & vel inde felicissimus
Quod ruinam sedis, cum superesse per aetatem non potuit,
Priusquam oculis conspiceret, vivere desierit,
Anno scilicet Christi innexu. Aprilis die xx.

³¹* Rectius xviii.
The following extract from Dr. Plume’s Life of that zealous
Churchman,† and excellent Christian, Bishop Hacket‚ prefixed

† Dr. Hac-ket is recorded as the last man in England who persisted ‘to
read the Liturgy in public, after it had been proscribed by the Parliament;
and the following well—known anecdote is given by his biographer, illustra-
tive alike of his attachment to the Church, and of his holy courage. ‘⁶ One
Sunday, while he was reading the Common Prayer in his church, a soldier
of the Earl of Essex came, and clapt a pistol to his breast, and commanded
him to read no further. The Doctor smiled at his insoleney in that sacred
place3 and, not ut all terrified, said, ⁶ he would do what became a Divine,
and he might do what became a Soldier ε’ so the tumult sor that time was

quieted, and tho Ductor permittcd to proceed.''
