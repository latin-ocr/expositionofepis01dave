392 AN EXPOSlTloN OF sT. PAUL'S Chap. ii.

ful. The Apostle hath elsewhere alleged the cause of this;
viz. Because the natm-al man receiveth not the things which
are of God;for they only ore ‹liscerued by the Spiric of
God‚· lCor. ii. 14. But a. philosopher, considered as a
philosopher, is nothing more than a natural man ; and rea·
son itself, not illuminated by faith, pertains to this natural
condition: it cannot, therefore, extend to the knowledge
of salvati0n3 and, if it should attempt, it miserably spends
itself in vain. Here, then, we renounce philosophy and
human reason, and confess with ,lustin Martyr, a theologian
rand philosopher, Paraen. ad Graecos, that Neither poets nor
,philosophers arefic anthorsfor institutiug α Religion, but God
alone by revelation. Which also Prudentius has expressed
in very elegant verse, which it will not be irksome to an·-
nex. In lib. 2. cont. Symmach. he is shewing that reason
cannot but fail if it intrude itself into divine things 3

Quippe minor natura aciem si intendere tentet

Acrius, ac penetrare Dei secreta supremi;

Quis dubitet victo fragilem lassescere visu,

Vimque fatigatae mentis sub pectore parvo

Turbari, invalidisque hebetem succumbere curis?

Sed facilis fidei via, &effi

Vide Hilar. l. de Trinit.

Neither ought this to seem wonderful. For if brute ani-
mals can judge very well concerning things which relate to
sense, such as their meat and drink, yet cannot judge of
human affairs: then, by a parity of reason, neither can
men pronounce by natural light respecting heavenly doc-
trine and Divine worship, although they may determine by
the aid of it, what is good and right in human concerns.

'⁵‘ Thus translated for his friend, by Mr. J. F. Pennie, of Lulworth,
,author of the ‘⁶ Royal Minstrel, Rogvald‚ Scenes in Palestine,” &c. ἃς,

“ Should man, inferior in his nature, strive
Into the secrets of his God to dive,
O, who can doubt his feeble sight would fail,
And his weak pow’rs of mind confounded quail
Beneath the vain attempt ! 'Tis saith alone
Can easy make her way—'’
to mysteries yet unknown,
