sin; therefore, he who, notwithstanding punishment, re-
mains a sinner for ever, will remain to be punished for ever.
Therefore, the mode of gratuitous remissiori alone remains
for our deliverance3 according to that parable of Christ,
Luke vii. 41, There were two debtors, the oue owed fifty peuce,
tlze otherfive hundred. How were they liberated? It im-
mediately follows, When they had nothing to pay, leefraulcly,
or freely and gratuitously,forgave them both.

All trespasses] Remission is not only gratuitous, but
universal. For it does not accord with the Divine majesty
and goodnaes, freely to remit some part of our debts, and
to require the other part from us ;

1. Because he remits to no one even a single sin, un-
less on the account that he has received the blood of Christ
as α ransom: but this being received, he would be unjust
if he did not remit all things, because it outweighs all.

2. Because to forgive is an act of paternal love, which
cannot dwell with hostile enmity : but enmity does remain
whilst any sins remain unremitted3 they, therefore, who
admit of a partial and half-remission, make God at once a
father and an enemy, reconciled and hostile.

3. Because, unless we reckon upon an entire and full
remission of sins, remission would be in vain, nor com-
prise its primary object3 but nature does nothing in vain,
much less the Author of nature. And this is evident,
because the end of remissiori is the attainment of life
eternal; but a partial remission cannot yield the hope of
life eternal, because death is the wages even of one sin.

If we consult the Scriptures, we shall find that remissiori
of sins is either entire and universal, or none is given and
promised. Jer. xxxiii. 8, I will cleanse them from all their
sins; andez'll pardon all their iniquicz'es. Mic. vii. 19, He
will cast all our sius into the depths of the sea. l John i. 9, He
will forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unriglzteousness.
Ye see, then, that remission of sins is gratuicous and uni-
versal. Hence we derive these Corollaries.

l. To forgive sins is the property of God alone: for
who can forgive another his debt, whilst the will of the
creditor is not yet understood? J, even I, am lze that blot-
