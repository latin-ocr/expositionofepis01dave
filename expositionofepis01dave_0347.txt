Ver. 23. EPISTLE To THE coLossmss. 261

rived from the utility and necessity of constancy and per-
severance in the right faith: for without this no fruit of
the redemption by Christis obtained; nye continue in the
fizith, Sto. The second is derived from the multitude of
believers, or from the common consent of all Christians3
-for this same gospel was preached and received through
the whole world3 therefore it is folly to leave this and em-
brace the new doctrine of seducers. The third is derived
from Paul's own ministry ; Paul, who was an Apostle called
of God, and taught the mystery of the saith by the Holy
spirit, had preached this doctrine everywhere3 therefore.
the Colossians ought to abide in this doctrine, and not
hearken to those new teachers, who drew them from Christ,
and would have them seek salvation elsewhere.

Ι] yse continue in thefaith grounded and settled, and be not
movesl away from tlte hope of tlte Gospel wlte'cle με have heard.]
This is the first incentive to perseverance in the true saith, ·
derived, as before said, from the utility and necessity of it:
From the¹ utilily in this manner, If με continue in tlzefaz'th,
διο. then Christ will present you lzoly, unblamable, and unre-
provable before God.· therefore it is highly useful to conti-
nue. From the necessity in this manner, Ι] ye clo not conti-
nue z'n thefoitlz, then ye cannot be partakers of the power
of those benefits which are offered in Christ: therefore it
is equally necessary to continue. For this verse connects
with the former, and unites with it the condition which
God imposes upon us, if we would enjoy the redemption
and reconciliation procured by Christ. There are many
things to be noted in this argument of the Apostle.

l. That by saith we are constituted holy, unblamable,
and unreprovable before God. This is deduced from the
very connection of this verse with the foregoing. The
Apostle had affirmed in that, that Christ had reconcz'led tlte
Colossians to God, in order to present them laotq: here he
adds the condition offatim, by which they apply and ac-
quire this holiness to themselves. Therefore‚ not an inci-
pient renovation, not the works which we do, constitute
us righteous and unreprovable before God ; but saith, appre-
licnding= Christ and seeking daily the forgiveness of sins.
