324 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL'S Chap.i·.

2. This desire is not extravagant, because it is in perfect
accordance with the revealed will of God. For that reveal-
ed will in the promulgation of the Gospel offers salvation
to every man without respect of persons 3 and no man is
excluded, unless he exclude himself by his unbelief.
Agreeable to this statement is l Tim. ii. 4, God will have
all men to be saved, and to come lo the knowledge of the trutlz.
What, therefore, God himself hath declared to be his will
in offering the Gospel, the same also ought to be the will
of his Ministers in preaching it.

But here another question is raised from the foregoing:
If God would have all men to whom he sends the Gospel
of salvation to be saved, why are not all saved 3 since the
will of God, neither in itself nor in the means by which it
acts, can be hindered in producing the effect intended?

A common answer to this question is taken from Augus-
tine: When God is said to will that all men should be
saved, we must make a distribution of individuals into
classes, not of classes into individuals3 so that the sense
will be, God wills that some should be saved of every
class of men. But to me the commonly received distinc-
tion of the Schoolmen between the will of his goodplea-
sure and his vz'sz'ble will (voluntate signi), is better suited
to this passage. We therefore reply, that the will of his
good pleasure is always effectually fulfilled, because it is
formally and essentially in God, and is his practical abso-
lute will, when employed concerning any future good. But
his visible will is not always fulfilled, because it is not for-
mally and essentially in God, and is not his absolute and
practical will; but, it is his declarative or approbative will
(if I may be allowed such a word) towards us. God is,
therefore, said to will, by his visible will, the salvation of
all, to whom he proposes and offers the Gospel, which is
the ordinary means of effecting salvation. Moreover‚ we
are not to inquire into the secret will of God 3 but all our
actions must be directed according to his revealed will:
and we ought, therefore, to wish and aim at the salvation
of all those to whom God vouchsafes to grant the saving
Gospel,
