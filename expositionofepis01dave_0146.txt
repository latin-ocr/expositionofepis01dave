60 AN EXPOSITloN or ST. PAUL's Chap. i.

xv. 9. That our works may be pleasing to God, saith is in
the first place required, Heb. xi. VVhence Prosper, De
vita contemplat. iii. 21, excellently writes, thatfaillz is the
foundation qf righteousness, which uo good works precede, but
from which all proceed .· it purges us from all sins, illuminates
our miuds, reconciles to God, &05³g

Hence it appears, whatever is done by unbelieving men,
however holy and pious it may seem, is yet the dead car-
case and image of a good work, not a good work, nor to
be recompensed by any reward which is promised to true

odline .
g We inSll adduce a few testimonies of the Fathem, be-

cause the Papists, who decry faith upon all occasions, and
extol works, ascribe a certain merit to these works of un-
believers.

l. Clemens Alexandrinusd* Strom. 1. says, When lffe is
ended it will be of ηο αυαὶί to men to have done rightly now,
unless [in conjunction with all tlzz's laudable morality] they have
saith. Augustine says, Whosoever hatlz not α rightfaz'th to-
wards God, with all lzis laudable deeds, departs from this life

into condemnation, lib. iii. contra duas epis. Pelag. cap. 5.

“ Prosper z—An Ecclesiastical writer of the fifth century, of great excel-
lence and eminence, and who at that early period ably opposed the Pelagian
heresy: he died about the year 463. There is an edition of his works in
8vo. so recent as the year 1732.

† Clemens Alexandrinus :—a distinguished Father who lived in the third
century. He was employed as a Catoehist, and afterwards made a Presby.
ter in the church of Alexandria. Under him arose many eminent meng
though, from the manner in which his mind was evidently imbued and
warped by the mystical philosophy of his time (in which he had acquired an
extensive knowledge, as any of his writings would shew)‚ his statements
of Christian doctrine were defective. He was a copious writer; but of all
his works only the following appear to remain, viz. his “ Proetrepticon, or
an Exhortation to the Pagans;” “ Pedagogus‚ or the 1nstructor;'’ the
,fragment of a treatise on the use of richeS‚ entitled‚ “ What rich man can
be saved ?'’ and his “ Stromata‚” the work cited above by our Expositor.
This title is borrowed from Carpet-work, and intended to denote the mis-
cellaneous nature of the philosophical and religious topics of which the
work treats. It is considered valuable, as containing many quotations from
ancient books, and recording several facts which are not be met with else-
where.
