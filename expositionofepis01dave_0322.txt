clared to be the cause why the Father sent his Son into the
world to obtain salvation for us, John iii. 16, God so loved
the world that he gave his only begotten Son. And in Ephes.
ii.4, 5, For his great love wherewitlc he lot-ed us, even when
we were dead in sins, lze bath quiclcened us, Sec. For, as Al-
tissiodorensis well observes, love is tlzefirst gift in which all
others are given.

But here a doubt meets us concerning this eternal love
of God. For it may be asked‚ What need was there of
reconciliation, if God loved us from eternity? since recon-
ciliation is not needed among friends, where there are no
enmities.

We offer an answer from the venerable Bedefit Thus,
says he‚rin Rom. v. God loved ns in α wonderful mamzer,
whilst he hated us: in every oue of us lze Izated what we had
domn he loved wlzat he himself lead done: i. e. as the School-
men say, he loved the human race as far as respects the
nature which he himself had made 3 but he hated it as far
as respects the guilt which men had contracted. Therefore
the love of God towards the being created by himself, mov-
ed him to devise this reconciliation : the hatred of God to-
wards sin, prohibited by him, but committed by us, sub-
jected us to the necessity of reconciliation. Aquinas,
therefore, 3 quaest. 49„ art. 4, rightly states the matter3
We are nol said to he reconeiled, as though God began to love
us anew ; for he has loved us with αη eterna( love: but because
hys this reconciliation all cause o] balred is removed, as well by
the remission of siu, as by the re-payment <ff α more acceptable
good.

Hence we are taught that our salvation is not the wages
of our merit, but the free gift of God. For this original
decree of human redemption proceeded from ευδοκία Βὶυἱηᾶ,

³⁵ In the account of Bede given on page 73, by inadvertence, aremark in-
tended to have been inserted respecting his History, was omitted, and the
Translator takes occasion to introduce it in this place. It is, that that
work, though drawn from such stores of learning as existed in the cotempo-
rary Italian church, abounds with evidence, that many dogmas which the
Papacy has of late years obtruded upon the world, were not known in the
Church up to Bede's time.
