tin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Tertullian.²’“ There
exists ηο race of men, whether of Barbarians or Greeks, or bear-
ing any other designotion ,· either of those who use their traines
for dwellings,† or of those who dwell in tents‚‡ or (ff those
who know not the use of dwellings, among whom prayers are
not ‹ffired up in the name of the crucg'fi'ed Jesus, &c-
Justin Martyr, Dialog. cum Tryphon. The word is
withheld from none, the light z's common, it hath shorte
to all men: there is no Cimmerius§ in the word. Cle-
mens Alexandrinus has these words3 Whom have all
people heard of? In whom have all nations believed, unless
in Christ? Tertullian, after enumerating all nations, adds
concerning us3 The abodes of the Britons, inaccessible to the
Romans, yet have been brought under suhjection to Chr-isal!
And elsewhere3 advers. Marc. he asserts, Thac Chr-ist had
captivated the whole world byfaz‘th in his Gospel.

Italy, so gloomy as to have become proverbial, and have its name used to
express any condition of obscurity.

‘⁶ There, under ebon-shades, and low-brow'd rocks,
As ragged as thy looks,
In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.'‘

ΙΙ Roman Catholic writers bave been accustomed to boast of the intro-
duction of Christianity into Britain under Pope Gregory, from the well
known circumstance of his being struck with the interesting appearance of
some of the §Vest Angles forced from Britain and exposed for sale at Rome 3
and many Protestant writers have given currency to the assumption-ss But
the obligations of England to him by sending Augustine to the VVest Saxons
have been strangely overrated. Tertullum, who flourished nearly four
centuries before Gregory, speaks of the important event of the recep-
tion of Christianity by this country as having occurred before lcz's day. It
had certainly been previously introduced into the greatest part of South
Britain, and was not unknown even at the Court of Ethelbert before Au-
