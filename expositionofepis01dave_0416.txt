330 AN ΕΧΡοειΤιοΝ oF s'r. PAUL’s Chap. i.

l. Every operation flows from some origin: it is pro-
per to inquire, therefore, in the first place, what is the ori-
gin of this most effectual working3 according to which
Paul says that he laboured and strove with so much con-
stancy and fortitude.

We answer, that Christ himself, or the Spirit of Christ,
is the efficient principle of this working: For thus Christ
himself promised, Luke, ult. 49, Behold Isend the promise
<gf my Father upon you ,· bat carry με in Jerusalem until ye be
endued with, power from on high, i. e. until the Holy Spirit
descends upon you, who will be the fountain and the prin·
ciple of all might and spiritual strength in you all. Hence
that glorying of the Apostle, Philip. iv. 13, Ι can do all
things through Christ who strenglheneth me.

2. We must inquire, how the Holy Spirit effects this
sufficiency in Ministers to fulfil the work of their ministry.
Not only by the concurrence and aid of his might, but by
the communication and influence of his grace. For he
creates in the minds of godly Ministers certain new and
supernatural qualities‚ whereby they are rendered adequate
to do and suffer all those things which devolve upon Minis-
ters of the Gospel. So Paul expressly declares, l Cor. xv.
10, By the grace of God I am what I am,· and lzz’s grace
which was bestowed upon me was not in vain .· but l laboured
more abundantly than they all: yet not l, but the grace quod
which was with me. And in 2 Cor. iii. 5, 6, Our szgfficiency
is of G0d; who hath made us able ministers (f the New T esta-
ment. How hath he made them so? By his Spirit as the
effective principle ; by the grace of the Spirit as the formal
principle.

Lastly, we must speak conceruing the effects of the Spi-
rit and of his grace strengthening us. Whereas, then, it
is required in a Minister that he both do and suffer all those
things which are necessary to further the Gospel, we say
the effects of this Spirit and grace are of a twofold divi-
sion. Some are to render the Minister fit for the duties of
his calling: of this kind are the illumination of the mind,
the sanctification of the will, love and regard for the flock,
and many other such endowments, with which the internal
