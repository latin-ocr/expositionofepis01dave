mrE or Bisuor DAVENANT. xix

peccata, &c, The popular copy thus states this ; that God hath
> elected to salvation “ a very small number of men,'' ἃς. and
appointed the rest to condemnatum, “ without any regard to their
infidelity ,and impiety.” This garbled statement, 01· rather “ deli-
berate falsehood‚⁷' as it has been correctly termed, originated withv
Daniel Tilenus, who, being a Remonstrant, and harshly used in
common with his friends, repaid his sufferings by falsifying the
documents of his enemies, and publishing his desperate effort
under the cloak of a “favourable abridgement.” From him it
was copied by Bishop Womack, from Womaek by Heylin, and
from Heylin by Bishop Tomline3 and thus passing current through
so many hands, it continued to exasperate the enemies of the
Synod, and even to excite the unqualified condemnation of its
friends. Thus the late Mr. Scott, in the first edition of his reply
to Dr. Tomline, not doubting the genuineness of the decree, ex· .
claims, “ Who told these presumptuous dogmatists that the elect
were ‘ a very small number of men ἶ· ” However, in 1804, the
University of Oxford published the SYLLOGE Conmssronum,
being acollection of Confessions made about the period of the
Reformation; at the end of which are subjoined the genuine
Canons, in full, of the Synod of Dort, as a contrast to the mo-
deration of the early Protestant Churches‚ and of the length to
which “ men, even publicly and solemnly assembled‚ may pro-
ceed, when enflamed by long controversy and embittered hatred.’'
From this publication the corruption was discovered, and exposed.
Yet, in a much later publication, by Dr. Copleston‚ now Bishop
of Landaffi in his “ Enquiry into Necessity and Predestination,‘'
the forged copy is given, with the observation, that “ In order
“ that the wide disagreement between these (i. e. the Calvinistic)
“ doctrines and the articles of the Church of England may be
“ seen at one view, Ι have subjoined in a Note the Lambeth Ar-
“ ticles, together with that summary of the decrees of the Synod
“ of Dort which Heylin has given from Tilenus, as the most mo-
“ derate and impartial account of their proceedings.” This is
evident enough, that the interpolation is not yet sufficiently public,
since it had escaped the notice of this learned and candid Prelate.
And here, one cannot but feel surprise that Mr. Nicholls, whilst
discussing these points in the Notes to vol. l of his Edition of the
Works of Arminius, and inveighing against every flaw in the con-
duct and opinions of autient and modern Calvinists, should not
utter a single sentence of disapprobation of one of the most au-
