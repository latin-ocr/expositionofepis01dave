XXXVl LlFE OF Blsnop DAVENANT.

those due qualities or requisite actions whereby they are made
commendable or praise-worthy in their several kinds.

“ In this sense, the Roman Church is no more a True Church
in respect of Christ, or those due qualities and proper actions
which Christ requires, than an arrant whore is a true and loyal
wife unto her husband.

“ Idurst, upon mine oath, be one of your compurgators‚ that
you never intended to adorn that Sti-[impet with the title of aTrue
Church in this meaning. But your own writings have so sully

- cleared you herein, that suspicion itself cannot reasonably sus-

pect you in this point.

“ Ι therefore can say no more respecting your mistaken propo-
sition, than this, If, in that Treatise wherein it was delivered, the
antecedents or consequents were such as served fitly to lead the
Reader into that sense, which under the word True comprehend-
eth only Truth of Being or Existence, and not the due Qualities
of the thing or subject, you have been causelessly traduced.
But, on the other side, if that proposition comes in ex abrupto,
or stands solitary in your Discourse, you cannot marvel though,
by taking the word True according to the more ordinary accepta-
tion‚ your true meaning was mistaken.

“ In brief, your proposition admits a true sense; and, in that
sense, is, by the learned in our Reforined Church, not disallowed:
for, the Being of a Church does principally stand upon the gra-
cious action of God, calling men out of darkness and death unto
the participatior) of light and life in Christ Jesus. So long as
God continues this calling unto any people, though they, as much
as in them lies, darken this light, and corrupt the means which
should bring them to life and salvation in Christ3 yet, where
God calls rnen unto the participation of life in Christ by theWord
and by the Sacraments, there is the true Being of a Christian
Church, let men be never so false in their exposition of God's
Word, or never so untrusty in iningling their own traditions with
God‘s Ordinances.

“ Thus, the Church of the Jews lost not her Being of a Church
when she became an Idolatrous Church.

‘⁴ And thus, under the Government of the Sci-ibes and Phari-
sees, who voided the Commandments of God by their own tradi-
tions, there was yet standing a Trne Church, in which Zacharias,
Elizabessr, the Virgin Mary, and our Saviour himself was born,
who were members of that Church, and yet participated not in

the corruptions thereof.
