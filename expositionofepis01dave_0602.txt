bound to one another, viz. the diversity of gifts and call-
ings emanating from the same spirit: for God gave some,
Apostles ; and some, prophelS: aad some, evangelisls; and
some, pastors and teachers ‚· jor the perjecting qs the saints, sor
the worlc of the miniscpy,f0r the edil'yz‘ng of tlte body of
Chre‘st; Ephes. iv. ll, 12. These, then, are those eminent
effects which are found by all who cleave to Christ the
Head3 but which are lost by those who do not obtain the
Head3 for to those who are separated and plucked away,
there is no place in this body, where all things are knit
together.

It remains now that we speak of the fruit which springs
from this union of the members to the Head, and their being
knit with one another, and the consequent effects: Ile ex»
presses this-in these words;

Increasetlz with the increase of God.] Whilst they conti-
nue united to Christ the Head by true saith, and knit
together by love, the whole body ofthe Church increasech,
διο. He calls the spiritual growth of a Christian in faith,
love, holiness, and all saving grace, the increase (gf God.
This growth is said to be ffGod, as well because it is from
God‚ as the primary agent3 (for Paul may plant, aad Apol-
los may water, but God givelh the increase, 1 Cor. iii. 6) as
because it tends to the glory of God, as its ultimate end;
and as a certain divine and spiritual increase, not carnal or
earthly.

We may observe of this increase of the Church,

l. As there is a growth in the natural body in all its
parts3 so in the mystical body of the Church, all and
every member of it increaseth spiritually : Therefore, that
is nota living member of this. body which does not in-
crease.

2. Not every increase is approved, but that which pro-
ceeds from God. For as a member of the natural body is
not properly said to increase when it is inflated with any
bad humour: so the faith οι· piety of a Christian man is
not increased when his mind is filled with human tradi-
tions and will-worship; because those things are not from
the Spirit‚ but froin the empty wind of ignorance and

pride.
