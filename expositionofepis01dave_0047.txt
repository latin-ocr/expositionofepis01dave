“ Thus, to grant that the Roman was and is a True Visible
Christian Church, though in Doctrine a False and in Praetice an
Idolatrous Church, is a true assertion; and of greater use and
necessity in our controversy with Papists about the perpetuity of
the Christian Church‚ than is understood by those who gainsay
it.

“ This in your ‘ Reconciler’ is so well explicated, as if any
shall continue in traducing you in regard of that proposition so
explained, I think it will be only those, who are better acquainted

course was a continuation of a Sermon which he had delivered
the preceding year on Rom. vi. 23. Charles testified extreme
displeasure; and the Bishop was summoned before the Privy
