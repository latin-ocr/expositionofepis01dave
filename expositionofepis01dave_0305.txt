ventures to assert, For any one to be called absolutely a mem-
ber ‘ff tlte true Clmrch no z‘nternal virtue z's required, but only
an externat profession (ff saith, and communion os the sacra-
ments, and anion with tlze Roman Clzzcrclz. Hence he mani-
festly places among the true members of the body of the
Catholic Church, ungodly men, disguised hypocrites‚ and
infidels3 provided they abide in outward communion with
the Church of Rome. On the other hand, observe what is
elsewhere said by this very Bellarmin.

l. They who stand related to the Church as evil humours
to the human body, are not true members of the Church.
This proposition is manifestly true ; for each sound body
desires the preservation of its members3 but it does not
desire to preserve evil humours, but to expel thern. Now
they who are void qfsaz'tlc and z‘nternal virtues, are, z'n tlze
Church, as evil lzumours are z'n the human body. Bellarmss

2. Nothing is truly and formally that which it is said to
be, having a diminutive term annexed to it; as a dead man
is not truly a man, a city in a picture is not truly a city.
Boys know this who have entered only upon the first steps
in logie. But the wioked and infidels are not living mem-
bers of the body of Christ, by Bellarmin's own concession‚
cap. 9: nay, he expressly calls them dead members in the
same chapter3 where he moreover adds, I Say that as z‘t per-

ing body3 a wz‘cked Bz‘slzop and a wicked presbyter ανε dead
memberS, and therefore not true members os the body qs
Christ. But now mark the dullness of this disputant. The
question proposed in the beginning was, Whether wicked
men and infidels were true members of the Catholic
Churoh which is the body of Christ, on account of their
outward communion and profession of saith? The Jesuit
undertook to defend the affirmative part3 and now he is
compelled to confess, that they are not living but dead
‘members ; that they are not true member-5 so as to answer the
purpose qs a member. But what is neither living, nor true,
nor answers the purpose of a member, how will Bellarmin
maintain to be nevertheless a true member? Hearken 3 He
