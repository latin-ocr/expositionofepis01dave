470 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL'S Chap. ii.

ing the Prince himself being vanquished, we may, to omit
other places, advert to the passage before ηε, and to Heb.
ii. 143 Christ by his death destroyed him who had the power
of death, z‘ e. the devil. Respecting the slaughter and con-
quest of the army of the devil, Hosea prophesied, Chap.
xiii. 14, O death, Iwill be thy plagues‚· O grave, I will be
thy destruction. And Paul, 1 Cor. xv· 55-57, triumphs in
the fulfilment of this by Christ, Ο death, where z’s thy sting?
Ο grave, where is thy victory ? The sling of death is sin ; and
the strength (ff sin is the law. But thanlcs be to God, which
git-eth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. You see
among the enemies subdued by Christ were death, the
grave, the law, and sin. Therefore, to sum up all in a
word3 this our chief adversary the devil, together with
whatever held man in bondage, or opposed human salva-
tion, was conquered and overthrown also. And thus is it
briefly shewn who were the eneniies spoiled by Christ,
made a shew of, and triumphed over; viz. the devil, with
all his satellites. Now let us examine what this spoilz'ng of
principalz'ties and powers, what this making α shew, and tri-
umphing over them, might be.

I find three opinions about this matter. The first is that
of Liranus, AquinaS, and many Romanists: who explain
this place thus 3 spoiling principalities, i. e. the infernal
powers or daemons3 by leading Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and the rest of the Old Testament fathers from the place
which they call Limbus, he led them, viz. the same fathers,
to heaven ; triumphing over them in himself, i. e. making them
triumphant. But every thing by this interpretation is dis-
torted ; here is nothing accordant either to the. mind of the
Apostle, or to truth: we reject this opinion, therefore, as
palpably false. The interpretation does not agree with the
context, because the Apostle asserts that they who were
led, and triumphed over, were those who were spoiled: if,
therefore, they account that the daemons were spoiled, they
ought also to account that they were led and triumphed
over. Add to this that the word ἐδειγμάτισε, does not de-
note a glorious leading to heaven, but an ignominious lead-
ing, such as of captives in triumphal pomp, as was before
