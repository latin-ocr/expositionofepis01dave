194 AN EXPOSITloN OF s'r. PAUL’s Chap. i.

But the exposition of those who apply the terms used in
this passage exclusively to heavenly and invisible beings,is
both more general and, in my opinion, more just. For

thus says the Apostle himself in Ephes. i. 20, 21, God hatlz
set Christ athis own right hand in the heavens, far above all
principality, and power, and domiuiom where without doubt
he understands what is heavenly. In the third chapter, in-
deed, he openly states that sentiment in these words, prin-
cipalities and powers in heavenly places, verse 10. Let us,
therefore, take it for granted that he is speaking of invisi-
ble beings.

In the next place, we must enquire what kind of dis-
tinction amongst the angels the Apostle has laid down in
these words. Dionysiusffi and the Schoolmen who follow
him, from this and other passages, in which angels are
spoken of under different names, so describe their various
orders, duties‚ and properties, as if they had themselves
been conversant with heaven for many years, and had
learnt precisely their whole polity. And though I have no
vast fondness for their fine spun coniments, yet, because it
is proper for the Divine to be acquainted with the errors
of Theologians of any name, I shall give a summary ofthe
points which are copiously handled by them.

of the estimation in which he was held, may be permitted a piace here, as
translated in ‘⁶ Coxe's Life of Melancthon.'’

Here then, Melancthon, lies thy honoured head,

Low in the grave amongst the mould'ring dead!

In lise 'twas thine to make all others blest,

But to thyself denying peace or rest:

Thine was the holy toil, the anxious tear,

Lov'd Philip—to the good for ever deal· !

O Earth ! let lilies here profusely spring,

And roses all around their odour flingl

For rose and lily each their glories blend,

The sweet, the fair, in our departed friend 1

Soft let him sleep, and none disturb his rest;

None he disturb'd while living—none opprest ζ

* Davenant, refers to the treatise of the Celestial Hierarchy, which,

though not of an earlier origin than the fifth century, was falsely pretended
to have been written by Dionysius the Areopagite, the Convert of St. Paul ;
and is commonly quoted, as here by our Expositor, under his narne3 which
is the case with the other forged writings imputed to him.
