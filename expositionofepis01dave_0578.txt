the law in the tables of the beart by the same Spirit. The
feast of Tabernacles delineated the pilgrimage of a pious
man through the desert of this world to the heavenly coun-
try ; the Sabbath represented the spiritual gladness and
rest imparted to the conscience by Christ; and the feast of
the New Moon‚ the enlightening of the Church by Christ,

Not to trace every instance, we may say with the Apostle,
Heb. X. l, This ceremonial law was a shadow (ff good things

monies. They were, therefore, partakers of spiritual good
things like as we3 but those good things which were pro-

a dg‘fference in the mode of bestowing· it. And Augustine, in
Evang. John tract. 25, remarks, To the antienls temporal
things were promised ; spiritual things were figttred. They
