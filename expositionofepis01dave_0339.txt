o. The last remains, which is ἀταξια disorder in the af-
fecffions, and rebellion 111 the inferior appetites against right
reason. Hence that saying of the Poet, Isee and approve
the better] course ; but I follow the worse. The human mind
is so hurried away by corrupt affections, that although it
perceives what is good and ought to be done, what is evil
and to be avoided, yet it cannot restrain itself from being
borne away in a contrary directioni. This depravity of the
human mind Augustine bewailed and wondered at, Confess.
viii. cap. 9, Whence tlzz‘s strange thing ? the mind commands the

116 asserts, lCor. ii. 14, The natural man receiveth not the
things ‹sf the Spirit of God. Most truly said Parisiensis,
De sacram. baptismi, The human mind not having obtained
grace, is nothing better than α dead body. We are not to

2. Amongst the heathen, or whatever others are not yet
sanctified in Christ, although there may be found sometimes
those who evince un appearance of holiness, of righteous-
