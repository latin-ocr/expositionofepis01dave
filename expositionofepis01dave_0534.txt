upon : l· Because that same power which raised up Christ
from the dead, infuses strength into us for this spiritual re-
surrection. 2. Because this resurrection of Christ is the
cause of ours, as also was before shewn. But now two
things remain to be cleared up which yield occasion for
doubt

l. The first arises from hence, that in these last words
Christ is supposed to be raised by the power of another;
whereas it is certain that he raised himself by his own
power3 according to that prediction of his, John ii. 19,
Desttoy this temple, and in three days [will rasse z't up. Christ
speaks concerning the temple (f lzis body, by the interpreta-
tion of John himself.

I answer, In statements of this kind, in which divine
operations are referred to God the Father, neither the Spi-
rit nor the Son is excluded, but the order of operation is
noted. For that saying of Christ is most true, John v. 19,
Whalsoever tlte Fallzer doetlz. those things also doeth tlte Son

own, was he raised up3 because the power of both is the
same. Whence says Hilary, De Patr. and Fil. unitat. He
himself pet-forms the worlss qf God tlze Faclaer by α nature not
di eringjrom God.

2. The other doubt, which is strongly urged by the
Anabaptists‚ is somewhat more difficult. For since in this
whole disputation of the Apostle, mortification, newness
of life, and, finally, saith itself, is connected withv bap—
tism3 but infants can neither mortify the flesh, nor produce
the fruits of a new life, nor, in short, believe; they con-
clude that those of that age should not be baptised.

We answer; If they speak of actual saith, of actual de-
sire, and the profession of mortification and vivification,
we say those places of Scripture which require these
things in baptized persons should be restricted to adults:
But with respect to infants, because they are sinners not
by their own proper act, but by hereditary habit, it is suf-
ficient that they have mortification and saith, not exerting
itself by a proper act, but included in an habitual principle
of grace. But that the Spirit of Christ can, and is wont
