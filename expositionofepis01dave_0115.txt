Ver. 2. EPVISTLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 29

We come now to the latter half of the second-verse.

Grace be with you aud peace from God our Fatloeer, aud
from tlze Lord Jesus Christ.

In these words is contained the third part of the title,
which we call the Salutation3 wherein two things are to
be remarked: the blessings which the Apostle desires for
the Colossians3 viz. grace aud peace; and the authors of
these blessings‚ God the Fame-7· (md Christ.

Grace be with you] In the first place we may make this
general remark, that the Apostles changed or rather am-

usual salutation was, Peace be to thee.- but after the mystery
of human redemption was revealed, in which God opened'
the fountain of grace to mankind, they also added grace.
And these two blessings are thus united for the best possi-

good : he therefore who wishes these two blessings to any
one, includes also every intermediate benefit. But let us

first gg'ft, says Altissiodorensis, in which all other gifts are
bestowed. Aquinas acknowledges this grace of acceptation,
Quaest. disp. de grat. art. 1. Secondly, under this term
grace the Apostle comprises all those habitual gifts which
God infuses for the sanctification of the soul. So faith,
love, and all virtues and salutary endowments are called
greces. The words of the Apostle in Ephes. iv. 7. have this
sense ε To every <me osus is given grace according to the mea-
sure of the gift of Christ. The Papists acknowledge this
inherent grace almost exclusively3 and in the mean time
think too lightly of that accepting grace which is the
fountain and well-spring of it. Lastly, grace denotes the
