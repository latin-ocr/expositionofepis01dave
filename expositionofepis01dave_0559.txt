tlze people of the blessed angels, viz. of that city which is
called by St. Paul mount Zion, the city (gf God, ancl tlte hea-
venly Jerusalem, Heb. xii. 22. Augustine follows up the
same opinion in lib. 2. contra Pelag. δι Coelest. cap. 30.
Here, then, he placed the fathers, immediately after death,
among the angels, although elsewhere he determines other-
wise about this matter3 as De civit. Dei. lib. 20, cap. 15.
But let us dismiss these architects of limbusfit who sup-
pose Christ to have spoiled the daemons in this sense, that
lie had emptied limbus, and taken the patriarchs away.

The second opinion is that of Jerome Zanchius; who
thinks these words may be explained of a real and visible
spoliation, exhibifflon, and triumph celebrated over the dae-
mons, in the presence of God, the angels, and blessed spi-'
rits. For although Christ might earn a triumph upon the
Cross, yet he conceives that it was completed when the
conqueror penetrated by his spirit into the infernal king-
dom, and brought out the daenions thence, and led them
through the air3 all the angels, and souls of the pious
dead, being witnesses: and he imagines that this triumph
was afterwards continued from the resurrection to the as-
cension of Christ, Itis my intention neither to confirm
nor oppose this opinion ε but, as it is doubtful, and cannot
be corroborated by manifest testimonies of Scripture, Ι
pass it by.

The third opinion, and which pleases me best, is that of
Origen‚ OEcumenius, and of almost all of our time3 who
interpret this whole passage of a spiritual spoliation, a
leading forth, and triuniphing openly accomplished upon
the Cross. He spoiled daemons then, he made a shew of
them, and also triumphed over them upon the Cross, when,
to carnal eyes, he seemed to be conquered and triumphed
over by them: For, as the kingdom of Christ is not of this
world, neither sensible3 so the victory and triumph of
Christ over our enemies‚ is not proposed to be surveyed
by the eye, but to be contemplated by the mind by faith.
