22, in Cantica, after he had proved that Christ was made to
men, as he had been before to the angels, wisdom, rigMeousroess,
sanctfficatiom and redemptiom objects as to the angels in
this manner, How there could have been redemptz'on for the
angels I do not see: for Scripture does not teach us that they
were captives through sin, or obnoxious to death so as to render
redemption necessary to them. He then answerS, He who
raised fallen man, granted to the standing angel that he should
210tfall‚· thas delivering the one out of captivit-y as he defend-
ed the otherfrom captivit-is: And on this ground there was re-
demptlon to both, liherating the one, and preservz'ug the other.
From these considerations, therefore, the first objection is
done away, and it is proved that Christ is truly called the
head of the angel& not only by reason of his ruling power3
but on the score of saving grace, although the angels never
were in a condition of sin and condemnation.

2. Since because Christ is the head of the angels, we
affirm that the angels are our fellow-servants, not media-
tors, or dispensers of grace 3 it is objected that we rob the
angels of their dignity, and snatch from them the ministry
delegated to them by God: for they are ministering spirits
sent forth to ministerfor them who shall be heirs of salvation,
Heb. i. 14. And in Psalm civ. 4, it is said, He malceth his
angels spirits, and his ministers aflame offire. By which
terms they suppose that some angelic virtue for the illumi-
nation of the human mind, and for exciting the will to the
love of God, is intended.

I answer3 We confess that God employs the ministry of
angels for many things 3 but especially in guarding the elect
and promoting their spiritual safety. For as the bodily as
well as the spiritual welfare of men is attacked by evil spi-
rits; so it is clear from theScriptures that in both respects
we are defended and assisted by good angels. To omit ex-
amples which might be drawn from the old Testamenti we
read that the Apostles were brought out of prison by the
ministry of angels, Acts v. 19, and xii. 17. And Christ
himself impresses terror upon those who shall offend one
of his little ones, by this argument, that they have angels
assigned to them by God the Father‚ Matt. xviii. But as
