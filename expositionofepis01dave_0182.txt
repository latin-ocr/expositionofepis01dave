96 AN exposm'ion oF s‘r. PAUL'S Chap. i.

The Apossse, therefore, here speaks of that spiritual
fruit which is perceived in conversion‚ and in the entire
change of manners and hearts, when men overwhelmed
before in vices, begin to bloom in virtue, and become re-

splendent in holiness.³’‘=

The Fathers every where laud this efficacy of the
Gospel. Clemens Alexand. in Protrept, for instance where
he says, The Gospelof Christ harh. tamed thestercesc beasc‘s,
viz. very] wz'clced men: and Lactantius, Instit. iii. cap. 26‚†

¹ This was fully exemplified in the conduct and characters of the primi-
tive Christians: the change ofconduct, the mental effects which conversion
produced in the early ages of Christianity‚ is unparalleled in the history of
man: “ We‚” exclaims Justin Martyr, “ who formerly rejoiced in licen-
tiousuess, now embrace diseretion and chastity: we, who resorted to magi-
cal arts, now devote ourselves to the unbegotten God, the God of goodness3
we, who set our affections upon wealth and possessions, now bring to the
common stock· all our property, and share it with the indigent; we, who,
owing to diversity of customs, would not partake of the same hearth with
those of adifferent race, now, since the appearance of Christ, live toge-
ther and pray for our enemies, and endeavour to persuade those who unjustly
hate us, that by leading a life conformed to the excellent precepts ofChris-
tianity, they may be filled with a good hope of obtaining the same happi-
ness with ourselves from that God who is Lord above all things-'⁹ In an
age of Libertinism, we see, the Christian was distinguished by purity. Ha-
tred was transformed into love, and the violence of passion subsided into
tenderness and peace. The proud became humble. The contemner sub-
mitted to contempt. All felt that the Illorality of their Religion was a fixed
and imperative Rule, and not, like the Ethics of Philosophy, mere reason-
ing, often too vague and imperfect to convince, and always too destitute of
authority to command. But this reform was vital3 it altered not sor much

the exterior appearance as Tm: INWARD HEART.

† Lactantius was a Christian convert of Africa, and an eminent writer of
the early part of the fourth century. On account of his fine genius he was
chosen by the Emperor Constantine to be Tutor to his Son Crispus; and it
is recorded to the commendation of his character, that, in the midst of the
Imperial Court, he lived in such contempt of earthly advantages, as to be
often in extreme poverty 1 His most celebrated work is his “ Divine Insti-
tutions,” which, whilst it powerfully refutes Paganism, is not free from
many erroneous views. He is the most elegant of the Latin writers on sub-
jects of this nature, and has been called the Christian Cicero, not only for
the clearness and purity of his Latinity, but from its resemblance to the
works of that Orator. His authority as a Theologian is, however, very
small, many of his opinions, even on fundamental points, being extremely
