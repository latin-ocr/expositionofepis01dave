of glory, but to the present manifestation of the Divine
glory. For truly spake Cyprian, in lib. De resurrectione
Christi. leese rose indeed, says he, before Clzrist, but in tlze
name and thefaitlz (ff Him; one tlzrouglz Elijalz when he was
living; one by Elislza in lzis lffetime, and another aster his
death ; bnt tlien tlzey again returned to death which they had
thus tasted. Lazarus also rose at the command of Clu-ist, and
some othe7·s; yet all these only enjoyed tlze gift of life for a
time, tlzen again returned to tlze grave. Bac Christ beirg
raisedsrom tlte dead, dietlz no more, as it is said Rom. vi. 9.
The resurrection, therefore, of these few preceding the re-
surrection of Christ, does not in the least oppose his being
called tlze beginning and tlzefirst-born from tlze dead: since
they rose neither by their own power, nor to everlasting
life3 Christ both by his own power and for ever.

2. Now let us come to the second reason of his being
called the beginning and thefirst-bornfrom tlze dead,- viz. be-
cause he not only, as we have before shewn‚ quickened
himself, and that to life immorta13 but because he is the
effective beginning and cause of the rising again of all his
members ; whether we regard the resurrection to grace from
the death of sin, or the resurrection to glory from the
death of nature. Ijoin them together, because, although
Christ never rose from the death of sin, inasmuch as he
never was subject to sin, nevertheless this one resurrection
of Christ is the cause of both in us; and these two resur-
rections are so intimately united, that whoever does not
rise beforehand by the power of Christ from the death of
sin, will never rise to the life of glory. Let us, therefore,
first shew that Christ’s rising again is the cause of our spi-
ritual resurrection.

Christ is the beginning of our spiritual resurrection, by
his death and resurrection, l. as the meritorioas cause; for
he merited this spiritual quickening of his members : 2. as
the efficient cause; for, by the same power wherewith he
raised himself from the dead, he both raises all that are his
from the death of sin, and regenerates them to the new life
of grace. So says the Apostle, Rom. vi. ll, Reclcon με
also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, bnt alive unlo God
