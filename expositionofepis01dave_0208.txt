122 AN EXPOSlTlON 01³ ST. PAut's Clzap. i.

l. Whereas the Apostle intreats a full knowledge of the
divine will for the Colossinus, we gather that a blind ig-
norance‚ however devoted, is not pleasing to God. For
that is not good which z's not rationally good: as Tertullian
intelligently remarks against Mare. lib. i.

2. Whereas he wishes wisdom and understanding for the
Colossians, we learn that that trust in the saith of their
prelates, which the advocates of Popery every where extol,
is not sufficient for the people3 for he who hath wisdom
and understanding, sees with his own eyes¹⁴ not the eyes of

others.
3. They are led not by an Apostolic‚ but an anti-Chris-

tian spirit, who deny to the people the ordinary means of
obtaining wisdom and spiritual understanding‚ viz. the
reading and understanding of the divine word: For the law
of the Lord is undfffiled, convertz'ng the soal ,· tlte testimony of
tlte Lord is sure, making ποίεε tlte simple, Ps. xix.

And thus much concerning the first part of the Apostle's
prayer, for those good things which regard the perfect

knowledge of the truth.

Verse 10.
Thatn‘ye might walle worllty of tlze Lord unco all pleasz'ng,
being-fruitful in every good work, (md increasing z'n the

knowledge of God.

We have dismissed the first part of the Apostle's
prayer, where he seeks for the Colossians those good
things which conduce to the perfect knowledge of the
truth. Now I come to the second, where he earnestly de-
‘sires' for them the perfect exercise of piety and holiness.

And, in the first place, it may be observed‚ from the
order itself of this prayer, That wisdom and spiritual un-
derstanding are poured into the minds of men from God,
not for barren knowledge and idle speculation, but for the

practice and exercise of holiness.
