Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE coLosslANs. 19

Ianswer3 To send preachers to infidel nations is not
now the work of apostolic power, but of Christian charity.
Every Bishop therefore in the vicinity of any heathen na-
tion, may, from the duty of charity‚ either by himself, or
by others, preach the Gospel to them3 and, if they should
embrace the Christian saith, what is to hinder Bishops and
rninisters being· set over them (if they require it) legiti-
mately ordained by any other Bishop? To extend the
Church therefore there is no need of a new Apostle.

We conclude, then, since the Pope of Rome is not im—
mediately called by Christ—nor embued with Evangelical
knowledge by direct and extraordinary inspiration of the
Holy Spirit——nor endowed with universal power over the
whole Church‚ he can by no mode of reasoning be styled ·
an Apostk, or Apostolic ΒίεΙιορές

Ver. 2. To the saints andfaz'lhful brethren in Christ, which
are at Colosse.

In these words is contained the second part of the title,
which we call the Inscription, in which the Apostle de-
scribes both the place where they dwell‚ and the character-
istics of those to whom the Epistle is sent: and this is
entitled the superscription or inscription according to our
custom, who are in the habit of inscribing these circum-

* The grand point at issue between Rome and her opponents, is the
question of Infallibility: therefore, to the refutation of this from the ac-
tual history and tendency of her doctrines, 'Mn Garbett's ‘⁶ powerful and
valuable work’‘ (as it has been justly styled) the ‘⁴ Nullity of the Roman
Faith'' is directed, and contains in its pages a refutation of the main argu-
ments of their most famous modern defence, Bishop Milner's ‘⁶ End of
Controversy.'' Upon the whole Difficulties of their system, it seems almost
needless to refer to the well known vqume of Mr. Faber in answer to the
Bishop of strasburg. For the recent attempts to remove the mass ofcrime
that lies against their Church‚ Mr. Townsend's ‘⁶ Accusations of History”
is quite sufficient. The present revival of this great Controversy, and the
modern garb in which their advocates have cloaked the Papal tenets, have
induced the Translator to refer the uninformed reader to works which ap-
pear to him to meet more especially the avisting state of the discussion;
and the study of which will leave him void of excuse if he be entangled in
the mazes of this never-slumbering and artful enemy.
