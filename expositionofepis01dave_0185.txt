stowed upon the. Colossians3 first, for their docility, be-
cause they had immediately embraced the Gospel; second-
ly, for their constancy‚ because they hitherto persist and
abide ian the same.

Observe, Hearers of the Gospel must not procrastinate,
but from the moment of its being preached they are bound
both to believe it, and to bring forth fruit. Thus the
Apostle‚ Heb. iii. 8, 'lb-day, if yse will hear lais voice, harden
not your hearts. And truly it is the voice of the devil
which says, Give the present time to sin, the future to
God and the Gospe13 yield the flower of your age to sin,
the residue to Religion.

Nor, secondly, is it sufficient, as soon as the Gospel is
offered, to receive it withjoy, and bring forth fruit3 but
it behoves us to persevere in each, viz. both in saith and in¹
holiness. The parable of the stony ground is well known,
which received seed, and brought forth fruit, yet to which
it is imputed as a fault, that those fruits withered away
through the heat of the sun. This inconstancy is also
blamed 1n the Ephesian church, Rev. ii. 4, Ι have somewleat

The grace qs God] He magnifies the Gospel from that
peculiar feature whereby it is distinguished from the Law.
For the Law declares the will of God imperatively, and in]-
poses its mandates upon us; the Gospel shews the will of
God savingly, and offers us grace in Christ: And these dis-
tinctions are not to be confounded by persons who would
not obscure the Gospel.

Here the error of the Papacy is detected, vvho promise
to the regenerate grace and salvation in the doctrine of the
Law. For they teach that men are justified by inherent
righteousness, and merit salvation by their works. Ifjus-
tification and salvation are by the Law, why should the
Gospel be called the doctrine of grace, and be distinguish-
ed by this title from the Law? Let Paul decide this ques-

tion, Rom. iii. By llze worlcs of tlze law slzall nofleslz be jus-
