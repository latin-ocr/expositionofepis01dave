tified .· for by the law is the knowledge of sin. Now the righ-
teousness of God without the law is manifested—by thefaz‘tlz of
Christ. For all have sirmed and are justffied freely by his
grace, διο. Aquinas himself, convinced by such evident
testimony, writes in this manner, The legitimate use of the
law is, that man should not attribute to it what is not contained
in it.- the hope ofijnstzfication therefore does not stand in moral
precepts, but in faitlz alone. In Rom. iii.

Ιη trulla ’Ev ἀληὲεία.] These last words are explained
very diversely. For some would have ἐν ἀληθεία to be no-
thing else than in tlte Gospel; because the Gospel is before
called the word of tlze truth. Therefore Paul here says that
they knew the grace of God in the truth, i. e. in the Gospel.
Of this exposition we shall say nothing now, both because
Ido not much approve of it, and because I have before
spoken concerning this title of the Gospel.

The second exposition is that of those who interpret in
the trutlz to mean in truth and sincerity, free from all external
disguise and hypocrisy3 and they refer this to the Colos-
sians, and to their praise, who, not by outward pretence,
but in reality‚ were embracing the Gospel.

Whence arises this clear evidence, that neither the name of
Christian, nor of the Gospel, can any ways profit men, if
the reality of the things themselves be wanting. For he
who is not a true Christian, is not a Christian at all; he
who is not truly Evangelical‚ is not Evangelical at all. For
eutily and trulh are convertihle terms, as the Metaphysi-
cians are wont to say. Hence that rebuke denouneed
against the Angel of the church at Sardis, Rev. iii. l, Thou
hast α name {hat thou livest, and art dead. But a mere name
can leave 710 place, either among tlze good or the bad, as says
Justin Martyr, Apolog. 2*

The last exposition is that of those who refer these words
to the praise of Epaphras, who had preached the Gospel
truly and sincerely to the Colossians, unmixed with the
error either of philosophical speculations, or the leven of
