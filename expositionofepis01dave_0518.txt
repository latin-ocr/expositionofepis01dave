432 AN EXPOSITloN οιτ sT. PAUL⁹S Chap. iid

ι’ to our souis, it may also be granted3 because, although to
pour the light of faith and the fire of love into human
minds‚ is the prerogative of God3 yet, as he employs the
externa] ministry of men to enlighten the minds of the
elect, and excite their wills to piety3 so likewise he em-
ploys the invisible and internal ministry of angels. Whence
the Schoolmen admit, that the angels cannot create or in-
fuse, yet they can enkindle, and excite spiritual knowledge,
good thoughts, and pious affections in the mind and will.
And they say that this is done in a threefold manner: l.
by removing impediments, driving away evil spirits, and
bad illusions3 2. 'by exciting and directing visions, by re-
presenting to the mind good thoughts; 3. by moving the
passions duly in the sensitive appetite, in inclining the will
to its proper office. But to what purpose do we urge so
⁸ many of these things ’.ἒ That it may be understood that we
do‘not disparage the office delegated to the angels by God,
as to the promotion of the salvation of the elect: and that
it may also be understood, that the ministry of the angels
in bringing about our salvation being admitted, yet they
are not to be worshipped by us, bnt to be acknowledged
for ministers of Christ, and our fellow servants, although
sornewhat inore honourable. For the same Christ who is
the head of the elect, is also the head ofall principali& and
power, i. e. of all angels. Therefore, as we are not to wor-
ship with religious adoration‚ either earthly kings or minis-
ters of the word, although those protect our goods and
our bodies by their external rule, and these direct our souls
in the way of salvation by their ministry: so neither ought
we to worship the angels, although they render the same
offices in a secret and invisible manner. But there will be
occasion to treat concerning the worship of angels when
we come to the 18th verse3 now let it suffice that we hold
ourselves complete in Christ, wlco is tlze head os all principality
and power.
