whether in faith or practice, not be boum] in this manner.
This is the verbal meaning: let us next examine the force
of the argument itself. The argument, then, proceeds from
the les‘s to the greater3 Ye have been delivered from those
ordinances which God himself prescribed: therefore, ye
must be delivered from the burthen of traditions invented
by men. Let us consider two thing83 the cause of this
deliveranee, and from what we are delivered.

[f ij bc dead witlz Christ] The death of Christ delivers
us froin the ceremonial worship: which was before ex-
pressed by the Apostle in other words, when he said that
by this death the hand-wricing of ordincmces was blotted out.
For first, the death of Christ merited that all his people
should be freed from the bonds of ceremonies: Secondly,
he not only merited that, but, a new covenant being con-
firmed, he actually abolished the old with its appendages,
viz. the Mosaic ceremonies: Thirdly, he brought to be-
lievers those very blessings which were shadowed forth by
the rites 3 namely, the expiation of sin, righteousness, ho-
liness, and all others: we ought not, therefore, to grasp
the shadow in ‹effi-emonies, when we have the very substance
in the death of Christ. But we have often treated of this
point3 therefore, it may suffice lightly to glance at it.

Let US, then, consider, from what Christians are deli-
vered. First‚ they are delivered, by the death of Christ,
from the rudiments of the world, i. e. from those ordinatrices,
or from that school discipline by which God himself for-
merly instructed the world by Moses, and which consisted
in weak and elementary matters: This is now supposed,
because it was proved above. Secondly, they are delivered
from the bondage of rites and human decrees: This is ga-
thered and inferred from the former deliverance ε for that
interrogation, Why as living in the world are με sulject to
orcle'nances? is as if he had said, [t is most unjust to impose
this yoke upon you; and ye will be most foolish ifye sub-
mit to it; for God would not have abrogated the cerenio-
nial worship instituted by himself, that a new one should
be devised by men.
