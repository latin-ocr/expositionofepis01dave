Verse 7.

Rooted and built up in him, and stablz'slzed in tlzesoille, as
ye have been taught, obouudz'ng tlzerein with tlzanlrs-
gzvmg.

That the Colossians should cleave to Christ, the Apostle
advises in the foregoing verse: now he shews somewhat
more explicitly how they are to cleave to him. And the
mode consists,

l. In the stability of that saith which adheres to Christ
and the doctrine of the Gospel; Rooted, aud built, and
stablislled.

2. In that fulness, or sufficiency, which saith in Christ ‚
acknowledges; ahozmding merem, &c.

3. In gratitude for this fulness which we have through
the faith of Christ3 witlz tlzanlcsgiving.

Rooted and built up in kim] The stability of faith is de-
scribed by two metaphors : The former borrowed from trees3
the latter, from buildings. The metaphor being rooted, is
borrowed from trees. For as trees cannot have stability
unless they send forth roots into the earth, and that earth
not miry, but firm: so our faith cannot have stedsastness
unless it fix its roots in Christ, as in the firmest soil. The
other metaphoris borrowed from buildings. For as a house
hath no stability unless it be built upon a firm foundati0n3
so neither saith, unless it rest upon Christ alone. Whence,
likewise, the Saviour Christ commends his prudence who
built his house upon a rock, but reproved his folly who
preferred to erect his upon saud, ‚Mam vii. 24. By these
two metaphors, therefore, the Apostle points out to us that
we should cleave to Christ as closely as possible.

And stablished in thefoitlz as γε have been taught] What
he has before represented figuratively, he now expresses in
direct terms, as interpreters will have: But he seems to me
to do even something more than that. For in those figu-
rative ternis he expresses that stedfastness of which our
saith partakes from having placed its roots in firm soil,
