272 AN EXPOSITION oF ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

Christ. For these words seem at first sight to imply that
the passion of Christ was imperfect.

Now as to the first question3 the sufferings of Paul, and
of all other true believerS, are called the sufferings of
Christ himself on two accounts:

l. Because of the mystical union that subsists between
the Head and the members, in respect of which not only
the Head, but the whole body of the Church, is comprised
under the name of Christ. For this statement we have the
clearest authority, l Cor. xii. 12, Foras the body is one aml
laath many members; so also z's Christ. In which expression,
the term Christ denotes both the Head itself, and the
Church united to this Head. Now it is customary for
every one to attribute to himself those injuries which are
inflicted upon any part of his body. Thus wounds of the
hand or foot are properly said to be the wounds of the man
himself3 and it is usual for him to exclaim that he is
wounded in the hand or in the foot. So also, in the same
manner, the Apostle, because he is himself a member of
the body of Christ, calls his affiictions the qfflictions (ff
Christ. This, then, is the first reason : Because Christ and
all his members constitute one mystic person.

2. The second reason is; because of the sympathy
Christ feels in the afflictions of his members, and which is
the result of the union before spoken of. For as we are
accustomed to consider the privations and sufferings of
those with whom we are most intimately connected as our
own, because we are as much afflicted with their distresses
as we should be by our own; so Christ accounts the suffer—
ings of his brethren as his own, because he is not less af-
fected by them than when he himself suffered. virgil in-
troduces Mezentius crying out that he was wounded‚ when
his son was slain by the sword of Eneas.

On wretched me my exile lies,
Now the deep wound is driven home.
