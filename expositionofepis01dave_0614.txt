in itself3 it would thence follow, that God may be worship—
ped in ways not only different, but plainly contrary to one
another, according to the will of rnen. For these human
commandments are not only different, but sometimes op-
posed to each other. You may see this in the different
orders of Monks among the Papists‚ on whom different
commandmeuts are imposed, such as relate to food, and
raiment, and almost all other externa] observances. You
may observe it also in the different rites of churches: for,
in administering the sacraments, in ordaining ministers, in
fasts, in feasts, and in almost all external rites, the cere-
monies of different. churches are different. And, as Ire-
naeus is quoted in Eusebius, lib. 5. cap. 23, The verz] differ*
euce cgfchurches in these thingS, the more illustr-ates the harmony
qf thefaitlz. But if these observances and ceremonies of
human command pertained in themselves to the worship of
God, and to holiness, there could not be any difference in
thern, they could not bind some, and not bind others, ac-
cording· to diversity of places5 but would be the same
among all, and would equally bind all. For that rule of
Parisiensis‚ De fide, cap. 2, is most true : The worship due
to God is not (ι worship which may be refused lo him wilhoue
itgjmy, by any person who is capable (ff worshippz'ng him .· for
the Rel.·'gion hy which God is worshipped, and hy which he ἐς
pleasesl (md set-ved by men is uniforme (md universal. From
these things it is clearly evident, that the commands and
traditions of men are not to be obtruded upon the Church
under the notiori of worship and righteousuess, because they
are the commandments of men and not of God*

Hence we. derive the following Instructions:

l. That alone immediately and properly concerns Reli-
gion and the worship of God, which hath the testimony of
the Divine will. It so behores us to worship God in the way
in which he himself has prescribed that he is to he worshipped,-
Augustine‚ lib. l. De consensu Evang. cap. 18.

2. They who would have religion, righteousness, ancl>
holiness to consist in observing their commanus and tradi-
tions, arrogate that to themselves, and their inventionis,
which is peculiar to God and the Divine commands. Men
