IN conipliance with custom, I have a few things to
premise, which may render the access to the ea‘plication
of the contea’t itself more easy ancl these I shall refer
to four heads: First, I shall say something of the
Colossians,' to whom this Epistle was written ,· neat, of
the occasion or cause of this writing; then, of the
particular design of the whole Epistle,· and lastly, of
the distribution of it into its parts. We now proceecl
to these points in the order in which they are proposed. '

Some seeh· for Colosse at Rhodes, inducecl by this
argument, that it is eciderit the great Colossus of the
Sun was in that Island; from which they will have the
Colossians to have derived their name. But the opinion
of Jerome and Chrysostom is far more probable‚ who
write that this city was situated in Phrygia, not sar
from Hierapolis and Laodicea. This St. Paul himself
seems to intimate, since in the fourth Chapter he com-
mands this Epistle to be read in the Church of Laodicea ,·
whence we may be allowed to conjecture that these two
Churches were near each other: but no one places the
Laodiceans among the Rhodians. fllweover, Abnophon
bears attestation to this, who, in lib. 1, De Ea'peditione
Cyri, writes, that after he had entered Phrygia, he went
direct to Colosse‚ a populous, wealthy, and great city.
Resides, Eusebius, in his Chronicles, relates that three
cities of Asia, (Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse,) fell
by the same earthqualce. Add to these testimonies‘Pliny,
who, in lib. 5, [Vatur. hist. cap, 32, has not placed
Colosse in any] [sland, but rechoned it among the T owns

of the Continent. But we need not anmiouslff inquire
