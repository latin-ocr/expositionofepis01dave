them. We see this done by Daniel, who judged that the

edict of Darius, concerning not praying to God, was not -

to be observed by him. We see it in the ApostleS, who
judged‘that they could not, consistently with piety‚ obcy
the commands of the priestS, Acts iv. 20. Finally, this
was done in the reign of Mary, by all our martyrs3 who
juclged rightly that they ought neither to believe those
things which were then proposed by the prelates to be
believed, nor to do what they commanded to be done.

From these things, then, it is evident, that even the
sec-ond colour also of submission and meritorious humility,
whereby human decrees are commended to the people, is
vain, and has nothing of true wisdom in it.

And neglectiug (ff tlze body, ἀφειδίαι σωματος, hot sparing tlze,
body, or severity to the body] Behold the third colour with
which human decrees being painted and glossed over, wear
the appearance of piety and wisdom. For since carnal
men are mostly employed in an inordinate care of the flesh,
they who afflict by fastfflg, waste by watchings, or subdue
by flagellating this frail body, Which others unduly cherish,
are supposed to be spiritually ivise, and careful of their
salvation above others. Therefore, all those decrees which
have for their object this subduing of the flesh, so strike
the eyes of the ignorant by that masi< of sanctity and nior-
tification, that they do not meanwhile observe the poison-
ous errors which are customarily concealed under them.
For in all these, impostors always present an outward mor-
tification of the flesh, but cherish within, mental pride and
hypocrisy. But for the better understancling of this whole
matter, we will bring forward, first, a few examples of
those who exerciscd this severity to tlze body: secondly, we
will expose the errors which usually lurk under decrees
and exercises of this kind: finally, we will shew what is to
be determined concerning these exercises of carnal morti-
fication.
