228 AN EXPOSITJON or s'r. PAUL’S Cleap. i.

V .
For z't pleased tlze Fathe5r32a1t9z'n lzz'm should all fulness
dwell.

The Apostle still proceeds in confirmation of those titles
which a little before he had bestowed upon Christ. But in
this verse there are two reasons complicated and involved
together, which we shall separate for the sake of perspi-
cuity. The first is taken from the efficient, or ordaining
cause, in this manner3 z't pleased Gon THE FATHER (for
these words must be supplied) that Christ should be the lzead
of tlte Clzurch, tlze first-born from tlze dead, &c. therefore, 011
the best possible ground, we attribute these titles to him.
So Peter, Acts ii. 36, said, Let all tlze houseqf Israel know
assureclly, tlzat God Izatlz made tlzat Same Jesus both Lord and
Christ: i. e. God the Father himself hath given the Church
to Christ, and in turn Christ to the Church, and hath con-
stituted him its head and Saviour, by his eternal ordi-
nance.

But how was this good pleaszcre of God made evident to
Paul, or how can we be assured of it?

1. From the testimony of God himself in his word 3 for
Moses and tlze Proplzets bear testimony to Christ the Redeem-

Christ, from his death and resurrecti0n3 in all which his
Divinity shone forth, and proclaimed to the whole world
that he was sent from God the Father, to gather together
the Church, and acoomplish the salvation of-rnan.

It is not withoutjust reason that the Apostle, ln speak-
ing of the Redeemer of the human raoe and the head ofthe
Church, puts us in mind of the good pleasure of God; be-
cause no one could take this honour to himself without the
Divine will and decree. For which reason God himself
revealed this his good pleasure by the prophets, as in Isa-
iah xlii. 6, I the Lord have called thee, and have given thee
