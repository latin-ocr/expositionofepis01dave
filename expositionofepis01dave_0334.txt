248 AN Exposr’rlON or ετ. rAUL's Chap. i.

Verses 21, 22.
Anclyou that were sometime alienaled and enemc'es i114your

In tlte body] of lzis fieslc tl'zrouglz death, to present you lzoly,
and unhlamable, and unreprovable in lzis sight.

The Apostle descends from the proposition to the parti-
cular application of it3 and what he had stated generally
concerning the reconciliation made by Christ, he applies
particularly to the Colossians themselves.

Where we have to observe by the way, That general
doctrines are of very little avail to influence the minds of
men, unless a special application of them be made to the
hearers. For that maxim of the Pffilosophers, Every action
is accomplished by contact, especially applies to the sacred
action os preaching. Every doctrine proposed generally,
is occupied, as it were, in a remote object, nor can it reach
to the soul itself; but when it is specifically applied, it
comes in a manner into the very interior of the mind, and
touches and penetrates 11. But let us examine the words

of the text.

In these two verses four things are to be taken notice
Οἷς

1. The miserable condition of the Colossians under the
state of a corrupt nature3 ye were sometime alieualed and
enemz'es.

2. The cause of this inisery, viz. their actual wicked-
ness3 tlte mind being intent upon wz'clced worlrs.

3. Deliverance from this misery under a state of grace3

4. The end or effect of this deliverance; to present you

holy, aud unblamoble, and zmreprorable, 810.

1. And you that were sometime alienated and emendes] He
begins by a description of their miserable condition under
sin, in order that they might entertain a greater gratitude
