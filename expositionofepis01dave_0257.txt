due to our sins: but the blood of Christ only, who was
without sin. Well spake Tertullian, Is thou hast offenderit
in no instance thyself, then by all means suffir for me: bnt if'

³* Our Author has frequently quoted Tertullian before, and no wonder
he should have done sog for the glory of God, and the increase of Christi-
anity, were the objects which influenced the conduct, and appear prominent
in the writings, of that distinguished man ; and induced him to devote his
life to the study of the Holy Scriptures; the elucidation of truth; and, ge-
nerally, the exposure of error· He was a Presbyter of Carthage‚ born
there about the middle of the second century. His father was a Centurion
under the Proconsul of Africa, and had his son well educated in all the ac-
complishments and learning ofthe Greeks and Romans ; and he grew up in-
timately conversant, as well with all that was ornamental, as instructive in
general literature. It is uncertain how he was occupied previous to his 9111,
bracing Christianity, though some persons have supposed he was an advo-
cate. His conversion took place not long aster the ccmmencement of the
reign of Severus, and a little before the conclusion of the second century.
Being a man ofa strong and vigorous mind, and dissatisfied with Paganism;
observing the efficacy of the Christian Religion over the lives and minds of
men3 considering its great antiquity, as it regarded its main principles
through the promises and prophecies of revelation3 the harmony and truth
of the predictions recorded in the books ofthe Christians; 1119 frequent tes-
timonies which the 1193111911 deities gave to its truth and authenticity3 he,
by such means, was brought to profess Christianity. The cruel conduct
which, about this time, was manifested towards the Christianis by Severus,
induced Tertullian to undertake the vindication of their cause. 'l'o 11990111ν
plish this object, he published his celebrated ⁶⁶ Apology,'' which has been
referred to at page 74, dedicatiug it to the magistrates of the Roman Em-
pire. In this work, with great learning and eioquence, he pleaded the cause
of the persecuted Christians 3 complained of the injustice of their enemies,
and the methods of their proceedings ; and demonstrated the falsehood of
the crimes with which they were charged: 119 proves the meekness and iu-
nocency of the devoted followers ofChrist; their temperance and sobriety 3
their piety to God, and obedience to their prince 3 the reasonableness of their
principles, and the holiness of their lives, beyond contradiction. The result
of this was very satisfactory, as it certainly, in some degree, mitigated the
enmity of the Emperor3 and for some time the persecutions ceased. Ter-
tullian also kindly and usef'ully engaged in writing to the martyrs 111 pri-
son, to comfort them under their afflictions‚ and exhort them to persever-
ance. About the year 205, the Bishop of Rome published a constitution,
by which he admitted persons guilty of adultery and fornication to a place
among the penitents. Against this constitution, Tertullian wrote his book,
cited by Davenant, as above—De Pudicitia. For this hc was excommuni-
