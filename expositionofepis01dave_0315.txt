Christ himself, on every occasion, enforces this decree of
God, and this his mission from God the Father, Luke iv.
18, lee Spc'rz‘t (ff the Lord is upon me, because lze hatlz anoz‘n-
ted me, ‘lle lzath sent me to preaclz tlte Gospel to tlze poor, to
heal the broken-hearted, διο. [sa. lxi. 1. And John iv. 34,
Mes meat z's to do the will <ff lzim that sent me.

Two things are to be noted here:

l. That salvation and grace are not to be sought in any
other than in Him in whom it hath pleased God they should
be sought. But concerning his will respecting it, we are
tojudge from the word of revelation. In the whole busi-
ness, therefore, of our salvation, this thought ought al-
ways to be present to Christian minds, What is the good
pleasure of God? For if we turn aside from his will, in.
vain do we expect any good. For example: I desire the
remissior] of sins, or deliverance from some impending
evil, or some spiritual grace: I hesitate about what must
be done to obtain the. object of my desire: The orthodox
direct that Ι should fiee immediately to Christ, and plead
his intercession alone with the Father3 the Papists direct
that Ι should flee to the blessed Virgin, or to other saints.
Here, then, what is to be done? You must enquire, What
hath been the good pleasure of God the Father‘.Z You
must obey his will. We easily shew you that it hath
pleased God that we should use the intercession of Christ
our head: 'out the whole tribe of Papists never will prove
from the Scriptures, that it hath pleased God that we
should approach him by the mother os Christ, or through
the saints.

2. Since ithath pleased God that Christ should be our
perfect and absolute Redeemer, it is manifest that they
undermine the eternal purpose of God, who have devised
new modes of salvation, of which it cannot be said, that it
hath pleased God we should seek remission of sins by
them. Hither we may refer human satisfactions, papal in
dulgences‚ and whatsoever is blended in the business ol
salvation without the ordinance of the Divine will. All
