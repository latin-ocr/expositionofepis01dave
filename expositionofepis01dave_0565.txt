had their rites and observances : for they who wished to be
accounted more holy, were accustomed to abstain from
wine and all manner of strong drink3 as we see among the
Nazarites, Numb. vi. 3, and in the mother of Samson,
Judg. xiii. 4. If any one also should drink out of a cup to
which there was not a cover, he was considered unclean,
Numb. xix. 15. These and other things of this kind the
Apostle concluded were of no importance to salvation, nor
were Christians to be condemned for the neglect thereof.

All these no one was permitted to violate in any part: but
the Apostle on the contrary concludes that no one is ne·-
cessarily to be observed in any part. This, therefore, is the
sense of the Apostle's conclusion3 namely, that Christiane
are not to be condemned as though they were transgres-
sors of the Divine law, or guilty of the violation of con-
science, because from henceforth they did not abstain
from meat or drink forbidden by the ceremonial law,
or because they did not observe the seasts enjoined by
the same law, whatever false apostles had superstitiously
