quired that particular persons should be assigned to certain
provinces.

And here let us observe how useful and even necessary
is this institution of the Church, that certain ministers be
attached to certain places and congregations. For if it
pleased God that the Apostles, who, by virtue of their
calling, might exercise their pastoral charge equally over
the whole world, should nevertheless be especially set over
certain particular provinces 3 how much more proper is it

If we adopt this meaning, there are two things to be learnt
from it:

l. That a minister is bound not to preach the word
vaguely, but ’πληρωσαι τον λογον, fully to explain and to teach
every thing that concerns the salvation of his flock.
