theological virtue3 this latter is the first among these three
celebrated theological virtues-'¹‘ And the perpetual con-
nection of this with love is proved by many reasons ε

1. Because this saith apprehends God as good and
mercisul, and the Author of salvation to a inan’s sels
through Christ3 and this apprehension produces neces-
sarily the love os God: For so Altissiodorensis, lee esti-
mation with which any one regards God through faitlz to be his
chief good, engenders the desire cf that good,- lib. 3.

2. Because justisying saith sanctifies and purifies the
heart3 but a heart void of love is not sanctified or puri-
fied.

3. Because every one who believes with true and justi-
fying saith, has a right to eternal life : For so* the Baptist, ,
He wlco believes >in the Son ΙιαίΙι eternal lq'fe. And Paul to
the Galatians, Ye are all tlze children qf' God hyfaz'tlz. But
these things are united in no one who is void os love.

4. The Schoolmen themselves shew that these three
theological virtues are always joined. So Altissiodorensis ;
All the virtues are united: forfaitlz is the necessary cause of
hope and love, lib. 3. But concerning the connection os
saith and love in the very act of believing, thus Parisiensis
writes; Living saith is not only α light to shew tlte things be-
lieved ; but a life exciting us to do οι· to decline those things, to

“ The “ lively'' or living saith os the Church os England, defined in
her l2th Article, which alone interests the soul in Christ sor justification‚
it has been well observed, is not to be confounded with the ‘⁴ formed'' saith
of the Church of Rome—i. e. a saith clothed in all the fruits which it is to
produce, andjustisying us by means of its fruits3 “ They say that the
Scriptures which speak ofjustification by faith ought to be understood os a
formed faith‚· i. e. that our justification is to be ascribed to our saith, only
on account os our love” and other sruits of it: “ nay they make love to
Justify, and not saith. But what else is this than to abolish the promises
again, and return to the law ?'’ lMelanc. Apol. Confess. p. 52, ed. 1537.
‘³ The Papists say that man isjustified by afim-med saith. They mean, not
by saith, but by other virtues.” Ι. Op. l, 373.—In the Council of Trent,
Marinarus “ liked not that it should be said, tliatsaitlz isformed with cha-
rity, because that kind os speech is not used by St. Paul, but only that saith
worketlzbycl1arity” orlove. F. Paul. 183. Conv. 1. 306. Vide Scott’s
Continuation of Milner's Church History : and also Bellarmin's conclusion
noted in this vol. p. 10: Note.
