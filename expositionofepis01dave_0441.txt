Ver.2. EPiSTLE To THE COLosslANS. :365

From the whole we gether how disgracefully the Papists
err, who say that we cannot believe the doctrine of faith
revealed in Scripture, otherwise than because the church
confirms it by its suffrage. That blasphemous saying· of
Hermanus is well known: that the Scriptures were worth
just as much as AEsop’s fables, unless the testimony of the

church were added to them. But if tlte full assurance of
understanding arises from internal light and secret persua-
sion of the Spirit3 then all the elect will recognise the

he was sent to the University of Bologna, to study canon law, but after
spending two years there, he set out to visit the most celebrated schools in
Italy and France. He went to Ferrara, where he was kindly received by
his relation Duke Hercules I. and studied under Batista Guarino. He had
a great readiness in acquiring languages, and is said to have been master of
twenty-two when he was but eighteen years of age. Trhhemius, his con-
temporary, says he was master of all the liberal arts, that he cultivated
with success, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature, was an admirable poet,
and the most learned philosopher and skilful disputant of the age. Settling
at Florence, he addressed a panegyric to Lorenzo de Medici, whose patron-
age he obtained. In 1486 he went to Rome. There he posted up 900 pro-
positions appertaining to dialectics, morals, physics, mathematics, &c. chal-
lenging any antagonist whomsoever to dispute with him upon any one of
them. But instead of opponents such as he expected, he encountered nn
accusation of heresy, and thirteen of his propositions being accused before
Pope Innocent VIII. he was silenced, and thought proper to leave Home.
He then returned to Florence, where he composed an apology sor his opi-
nions 3 and was at length acquitted of all blame. The effect, however, of
the anxiety produced by this business, caused a total change in his course of
life3 and though young, rich, elegant in person and in manners, and in
some degree habituated to pleasure, he gave himself up to devotion, and
confined his studies to theological subjects. These induced a most enthusi-
astic desire to be useful, and he resolved to distribute all his property
among the poor, and travel barefooted through the world to preach the
Gospel. An early death, at the age of 32, put an end to his projects. His
principal works are—‘⁶ HexapIUS, oran Explanation of the Six Days os the
C1·eation;” a book on the Psalms, another, “ Adversus Astrologiam Divini
tricem, & Epistularum, lib. viii.'’ He also wrote on the Jewish Cabala,
which was in great credit in the sixteenth century. He was one of the
learned men whom Nande has thought it necessary to vindicate from the
charge of being a Magician, The writings of Picus, it is said, ‘⁴ display an
acute genius, and a vast extent of learning.'’ He is admitted on all hands
to have been a very extraordinary person, and was denominated the Phoenix
among the geniuses of his time. But his works added very little to true
science, notwithstanding his attainments and erudition.
