Ver. 15. ErisTLE το THE coLOSSIANs. 175

3. Lastly, it is not a shadowy image of the Father that
he bears, in a nature dissimilar, but in the same essence
and Divine nature.

It may be asked, How is Christ called the image of
God, when he himself is God, for it is impossible that the
same thing should be called the image of itself?

We answer, The word Goa⁷ is, in this place, taken with re-
ference to person, not to essence3 for it designates the
Father only, not the Divine nature in general. Christ,

his guilt in such forcible and pathetic terms, as to induce his remorse, con-
trition, and repentance. Ambrose died in peace at the seat of his Bishopric,
at the age of 64, after having been twice compelled to leave it through the
troubles and wars of his time. Amidst every other fluctuation, he evinced
a simple dependance on the mercy and grace of the LordJesus 3 and left
behind him a bright example of indefatigable exertion, and of zealous de· ·
votedness to the duties of his sacred calling· His character and conduct,
however, have been variously judged of, and as diversely represented, ac-
cording to the partialities and prejudices of men who have undertaken to
canvass his active habits ; to scrutinize his ardent zeal in the cause of reli-
gion, and on behalf of the church ; or to criticise the numerous writings he
left behind him. On a careful and repeated review of every account ot'this
Father which the present writer could obtain, he is disposed to adopt the
concluding remarks of Dr. Adam Clarke's notice of Ambrose and his writ-
ings, as affording the fairest representation: ‘⁸ Having been bred up in the
‘⁶ midst of State affairs till advanced in life, his knowledge of Tlacology must
‘² necessarily have been both limited and superficial3 hence we find him
“ flying to allegory for interpretation—the easy resource of an uninformed
“ mind but a lively conception, as requiring no argument to prove it, and
“ no study to frume it. His works on lilorals are, undoubtedly his best
‘⁶ performances, and evince the strong conceptions of an upright character:
‘⁴ in Docti-ine he is all that Rome could wish him, and a mysticising fancy
‘² could make him: as a Disciplinarian he has the noble fortitude of a inan
“ conscious of rectitude, and yet not austere where circumstances appeared
a< to call for lenity, (Epist. to Sinagrz'us).” There is reason, however, from
the very numerous confiicting opinions respecting Ambrose, to apprehend,
that a correct opinion of what he was, can hardly be formed from his works
as now extant ς since Papa] expurgators and emendators, seeing what might
be made of them, may have turned them to as good an account in their fa-
vour as Cyprian's: For what will not Jesuitical policy and authority, in-
trigue and ingenuity effect, where it has the power and influence, and as the
circumstances of the bffldle'ble Church require Ρ Ambrose was a composer of
Hymns, and is understood to have been the first who introduced regular
choral music into the Christian Church.-Vide “ Clarke's Succession of

Sacred Literature,'' and Encyclop. Metropol. under ‘² Ecclesiastical WVriters
