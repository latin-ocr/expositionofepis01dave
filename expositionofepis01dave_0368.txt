28⁴2 AN ΕΧΡοειτιοΝ oF ST. PAUL’S Chap. i.

3. Lastly, the intention of the person making satisfac-
tion is required, where the sufficiency or satisfactioni of one
is to be applied to the remission of another: but it can
never be shewn, that either Peter, or Paul, or any other
saint suffered with the intention of cur receiving remissior]
of our sins (as to punishment) by their sufferings. There-
fore the third proposition, which supposes a store of satis-
factions of the saints transferable to us, falls to the

ground.
Argum„ 4. If there were a store of merits and sufferings

in the Churcb, (which, as to the merits and sufferings of
Christ, is most true, for in Christ there are all treas-ures) yet

in which she places her chief glory, abhorring to shed the blood even of the
most detestable heretics. How different the spirit of that church is now
(remarks the Biographer of Leo, from whom we here borrow), those too
well know who have ever had the misfortune to be any ways concerned with
that tribunal, of all that ever was heard of, the most 'cruel and sanguinary-
the Tribunal of the Inquisition. And, we may remark, what different doc-
trines appear to have been inculcated, as well as different conduct practised
in the church of Rome in Leo's time, to what has been since taught and
enforced by the Papal See! At the fourth General Council at Chalcedon,
in 451, assembled to condemn the heresy of EutycheS, who, virtually at
least, denied the human nature of Christ, the Legate of Leo delivered a
letter from him, in which he defended the Scriptural doctrine on the sub-
ject, with a perspicuity so extraordinary at that period, that his Epistle was
received as a rule of saith, was called emphatically the Columna 01111οᾶ0αά-
Fidei, and constantly read, during Advent, in the WVestern churehes. Leo
suppressed the custom of publicly confessing private sins, but recommeuded
auricular Confession, thch had been abolished, about 70 years before, by
Nectarius, at Constantinople3 and which has since been niagnified into a
Sacrament. But Leo's most material achievement was the stop which his
personal interference put to the ravages of Attila in Italy, whom he per-
suaded, when at the very gates of Rome, to withdraw his forces. With
Genseric he was afterwards, in 455, scarcely less successful; as, although
he could not prevent that barbarian from taking and plundering Rome, he
yet so far prevailed as to divert him from his design of burning it. Du
Pin, who seldom loses an opportunity of striking at the arrogance and pre-
sumption of the head of his own church, observes, ‘⁶ The church of Rome
never had more true grandeur and less pride than in this Pope's time. The
Bishop of Rome was never more honoured, more considerable, and more
respected than in this Pontiff; and yet never carried himself with more hu-
mility, wisdom, sweetness, and charity.” He died in 461, having occupied
the papal Chair 21 years: His works, which consist of Sermons and Let-
ters, were published by Father Quesnel, in two vols. solio, 111 17θο.
