lx οΝ DlVERSITY or DEGREES.

Nevertheless, it is manifest that the censure proceeded from the
Episcopal authority alone, and passed as an act of Episcopaljuris-
diction upon offenders. For excommunication is called the Epis-
copal sworcl. In the case of excommunication, there was an ap-
peal from the episcopal judgment to a Synod3 which confirmed
the Bishop's censure if it had been rightly denounced‚ or rescind-
edit, if otherwise. Theresore, in the act of excommunicatum,
not the people‚ nor the Presbyters, are the aeknowledged judges,
but the Bishop alone. That this was the discipline of the primi-
tive Church, can be made clear from antient Councils. Let the
Councils of Nice, Can. 5; of Antioch, Can 6; of Sardium,
Can. 14, be inspected. Nay‚ Jerome himself does not doubt
that the power of excommunicating Presbyters belongs to the
Bishops. Hence he writes thus to Riparius (Epist. 53) concerning
Vigilantius, an heretical Presbyter, Iwonder that the holy Bishop
in whose diocese he is said to be α Presbyter, sits quiet at the
frenzy of tlte man, and does not break this unprofitable vessel
with the Apostolical and z'ron rod, and deliver Izim to the destruc-
tion of tlzefleslz, that hz’s spirit may be saved. These things shew
clear enough, that, from the very Apostolical times, Bishops were
superior in power and degree to Presbyters, and that a parity
among ministers of the Gospel never obtained. But a few argu-
ments, which are alleged for the contrary, remain briefly to be
-solved z

l. Christ himself seems to prohibit this inequality among
Gospel Ministers, in Matt. xx. 25, 263 The princes of tlte Gen-
tiles exercise lordslzip over them: but it shall not be so cwnong you.
To which St. Peter adds, 1 Epis. v. 2, 3, Feed tlzeflock of God
which. is amony you, takiny the oversz'ylzt thereos, not by con-
straint, bul willinyly; ‘notforfiltliy lucre, but of α ready mind:
Neitlter as being Zords over God's hericage, but beiny ensamples to

In reply, We allow, that as to the Apostles, they were all equal
in degree and authority, according to the institution of Christ;
but we deny that this passage, or any other, establishes that parity
among ministers of the Gospel which they contend for who attack
the episcopal dignity. For, notwithstanding this command of
Christ, the twelve Apostles were higher in dignity and greater in
authority than the seventy disciples. And, notwithstanding this
sume command, there were constituted by the Apostles themselves
<as hath before been shewn) in the church of Ephesus, os Crete,
