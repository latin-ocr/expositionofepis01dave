Ver. 1. prs‘rLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 9

pect either an angel from heaven, or extraordinary visions
and divine revelations3 we have¹ only to hearken to apos-
tolic doctrine, and it will be the power of God to salvation
to all ΐΙιαιι believe.

2. It also follows, that this appointment of Apostles by
the will of God, discovers to us the wonderful love of God
towards mankind, and his inexpressible desire of our sal-
vation. For what else is sending Apostles into the world,
than sending ambassadors who should pray and intreat men
that they would be reconciled to G0d; that they would
embrace the offered salvation? Hence Paul calls the apos-
tolic work the ministry os reconciliation, and says, 2 Cor. v.
20, Now then we are ambassadorsfor Christ, as though God
did beseeclz you by us, we pray you in Clzrz'st’s stead, be ’με .
reconciled to God. Behold the goodness and loving-lcz'ndness
of God, and that spontaneous‚ not calledfor, as Tertullian

Now, in the last place, it will not be foreign to our pur-

folio volumes have been an exhaustless armoury whence her modern de-
fenders have supplied themselves with weapons, though they have found it
convenient seldom to imitate his ingenuousness; for his works are honour-
ably distinguished for the full and candid way in which the Protestant views
are stated. The celebrity of his labours may be evinced by the circum-
stance that all the most learned and eminent of the Reformed Advocates
deemed it right to direct their powers against this famous controversialist.
Yet notwithstanding his pre-eminence among her vindicatore„ it has been
rightly observed by a living Prelate, that “ Bellarmin was not in the best
odom· with the See of Rome ; his notions of the Papal prerogative not being
sufficiently high to reach the views there entertained of> the Pope's supre-
macy.” (Bp. Van Mildert’s speech before the House of Lords, 1825.)-
