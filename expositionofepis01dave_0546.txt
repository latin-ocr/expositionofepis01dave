460 AN EXPOSlTlON or s'r. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

heart, the love of any sin, and resolves to continue in the
sanie, flatters himself in vain about his sins being re-
mitted.

4. Troubled consciences have here wherewith they may
sustain themselves3 for the Apostle said not, You hath he
quickened‚ having destroyed all sins, but having forgiven.
Therefore‚ although we may perceive sin lurking in us, and
opposing the Spirit3 yet, if it is not pleasing to and ruling
us, it does not exclude this spiritual quickening. For the
universal remission of sins takes away the guilt of all our
sins ; and the infusion of grace joined to this takes away
the dominion of them all: but neither remission nor grace,
whilst we bear this mortal body, takes away the nature, or
the motion of indwelling sin.

Verse 14.

Blottz‘ng out tlze leand-ufrt'ling of ordinauces that was against
us, wlzz'clz was contrary to us, and took it out of the
way, naz'ling it to leis cross-

The Apostle illustrates the benefit of the remission of
sins, concerning which we have discoursed above3 and in
doing so he teaches that Christians are not now, after all
their sins are remitted‚ to be brought again under the ob-
ligation of the law, especially of the ceremonial law. And
the reason is derived from the removal of the thing to the
removal qf the sign, for the legal rites were as so many
hand—writings‚ or appendixes to hand-writings, to signify
the guilt of the human race3 therefore, guilt being taken
away by the blood of Christ, it is right this hand-writing
also should be abolished.

But that we may the better arrive at the meaning of the
Apossse, we shall lay down three points to be explained,
which being explained, we shall perceive both the sense of
the words, and the matter contained in them.
