36 AN 1<2xPosrr10N OF ST. PAUL’s (fhap. i.

Father would have all things to be subject unio him,- and
made him to sit above all powers, Ephes. i. 20, 21, and Heb.
ii. 8, He put all things under him. But he is the Lorcl of the
godly‚ not only by right of Sonship‚ but also by right of
redemption and deliverance.

Ye see whence grace flows to us, From God our Father,
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence observe

1. They who are estranged from God through obstinate
perseverance in sin, are destitute of quickening grace3
and, if we speak of spiritual life, they are dead carcases‚
not men. For as a man who turns himself away from the

frame their life and manners according to the will of their
master3 diligently to discharge the duty assigned them by
their master3 to form no friendships with the enemies of
their master3 if they err humbly to submit themselves to
their master3 and innumerable other things of the like na—
ture; which, so long as we neglect, we deny that Christ is
our master not by our lips, but by our lives.

And thus far we have unfolded the apostolic salutation.
