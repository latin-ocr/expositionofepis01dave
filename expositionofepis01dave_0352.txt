Paul himself deprecates this perfidy which the l’apists
palm upon all the Apostles: Acts xx. 26, Ye are my wit-
nesses that I am pure from tlte blood of all men. For I have
not sliunned to declar-e mito you the whole counsel (ff God.

2. Hence we also infer, That the word of God is not to
be withheld from the laity, but that all men are to be in-
vited to the reading, hearing, and meditating on it. For if
the Apostles have promulged to all people, all things ne-
cessary to salvati0n3 if they committed the same to writ-
ing, that from the knowledge thereos the man (ff God may
beperfect, thorougkiyfnrnished to every good work, 2 Tim.
iii. 17, why is that Gospel now pertinaciously denied to a
Christian people, which was preached to every creature
from the beginning? Whatever they insist upon in oppo-
sition to the reading of the Gospel, the same might have
been alleged against the preaching of it: For many under-
stood not the Apostolical declarations3 many, misunder-
standing them, perverted them to establish errors. But
notwithstanding these things, the Apostles invited all to
hear3 therefore, we also ought to call upon all to read.
But, on the other hand, the Papisls fear lest their people
should be injured by reading the Scriptures, though they
have no apprehension lest they should be injured by read-
ing foolish and lying fables. The orthodox Fathers have
bothjudged and spoken otherwise about the Scriptures.
Chrysostom frequently exhorts the people to read the
Scriptures witlz all diligence. Hom. 9. in Epist. ad. Coloss.
He hath the like in Hom. 3, De Lazaro, and elsewhere.
Augustine, De utilitate credendi, ad Honor. cap. 6, says,
lee doctrine of Scripture z's so adapted, that every one cannot
bnt draco from thence wlzat z's sufficient for him, τ’] he only
comes to draw devotedly and pionsly. It will not be tedious
to add to these that most admirable testimony of Damas-
cenus, De fide orthod. lib. iv. cap. 18: Κάλλιστον καὶ
ψυχωφελέστοιτον, &c. The best and most uscjfnl tlzingfor the
