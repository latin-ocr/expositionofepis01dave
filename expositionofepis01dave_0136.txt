50 AN EXPOSITION OF ΞΤ. PAUL’S Clzap. i.

That he, voluntarily remaining· in grievous sins, can believe
that sins are remitted him, or ought in his present condi-
tion soto do: but we say, that he, by the help of God,
may, and is in duty bound to come out of that state, and
to believe this.

3. It is not expedient that nien should have certainty

Answer. We do not maintain that true believers never
doubt either the remission of their sins, or the state of
their reconciliation with G0d; but we contend that these
doubts arise from the flesh, not from saith. This, there-
fore, is the difference between us and the Papists: They
commend doubt in the faithful themselves, and attribute it
to the virtue of humility3 we recognise it as sin, and say
