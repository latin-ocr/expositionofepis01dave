and others. chief Pastors, who had a power of jurisdiction not
only over the laity, but over the elders of their own churches.
Therefore, neither Christ, nor Peter, intended to take away dif-
ference of degrees among ecclesiastical persons 3 but, whilst they
granted to the Apostles, and to the Bishops their suceessors, Pas-
toral rule and Paternal superiority, they would not have them to
assume over the elders, or the people of God, a νομαί οι· lordly
dominion. This inequality Jerome acknowledged in his Epistle to
Nepotian: Be subject to thy Pontzff', and receive him as a father
to thy soul. And a little after, Let the Bishops know that they
areprz‘ests, not lords: let them honour the Cleryy, as Cler9y‚·
and also let honour be pais! to them as Bishops oy the Cleryy.

2. Itis objected‚ that in the Acts, and in the Epistles of St.
Paul, Presbyters are called Bishops, and vice versa. Hence
some labour to prove not only that Presbyters are equal to BishopS, .
but that they are altogether the same with Bishops. Thus, Acts
xx. 17, 28, Paul addressing the Presbyters of one Church, calls
them all Bishops. So also Phil. i. l, he calls all the Preslvyters
of that Church, Bishops; and Titus i. 7, he designates the same
persons with the name of Presbyters and Bishops. Moreover,
the Apostle Peter applies the name Elder or Presbyter to himself,
1 Epis. v. l, lee Elders which are among) you I exhort, wlzo am
also myself a Fennow ELDER. So also St. John, Epis. ii. and
iii., calls himself tlte Elder. From which passages, Jerome
(Epist. ad Evagrium) long since inferred, that the Apostles clearly
taught that Presbyters and Bishops are the same.

'l'o this, we concede, that in the time of the Apostles, these titles
were promiscuously used ; and that for many reasons. First, the
Apostles, being in or near the spot, placed, for the time, in many
churches which they founded, Presbyters alone, with equal power,
to whose care in common the church was commended. And they
were rightly called Bishops, whose office it was to superintend
and preside over the flock committed to them. Furthermore, in
those things which are of greatest moment to the salvation of
men, viz. in preaching the Gospel and dispensing the Sacraments,
Presbyters, no less than Bishops, keep watch, and superintend
the promoting the salvation of souls3 wherefore, the name
Bishops would aptly be applied to them. Finally, it is probable
that the ApostleS, to testify humility, mingled the terms of eccle-
siastical offices; because, as Gregory says, in respect of liumz'lz'ty,
all Priests are eqzcals. But as the Apostles were not, therefore,
