Christ. Immediately after which he adds, I takeyou to re-
cord tlzis day, that I am pure from the blood of all men ,· for
I have not shzmned to declare unto you the whole counsel <ff

Hence many inferences might be deduced.

l. The whole sum of Christian wisdom consists in de-
pending upon Christ alone, and understanding the counsel
of God concerning our salvation obtained by him. He who
sincerely holds this doctrine is accounted as furnished with
all wisdom.

2. The Apostles have publicly set forth every thing
which is necessary for obtaining salvation in Christ3 the
obscure traditions, therefore, of which the Papists have so
many fables‚ are no part of that wisdom which is unto sal-
vation. And the reason is obvious : For the wisdom which
is necessary to salvation was preached by the Apostles
openly to all men; but these traditions of theirs‚ accord-
ing to their own account, were not entrusted to all, but
only to the-ir prelates, or other eminent men among them.
Therefore the knowledge of them is not necessary for the
salvation of a Christian. If we consult the Fathers,
though they allow of some traditions as to external ordi-
naneeS, and the indifferent usages of the Church, yet, in
all matters concerning saith and salvation, they, one and
all, hold that the doctrines of Scripture which the Apostles
preached, and afterwards committed to writing‚ are suffi-
cient. Tertullian, De praescript. says, Since tlze coming of
Christ, there has been no need-for speculation ; norfor inquisi-
tiveness since tlte promulgation os the Gospel. And Augus-
tine‚ in his comment upon John xi. tract. 49, observes,
T hose things were selected to be written down which seemed διψ-
ficientfor the salvation of tlzose who believe. I add no more
on this topic now, having touched upon the error before
more than once.

3. The man who is not apt to teach, nay more, who is
not able to instruct God's people in all spiritual wisdom, is
not a fit minister of the Gospel. To this end Paul (Tit.
i. 9) requires in a spiritual pastor not only the knowledge
