way3 but all things are to be done according to tlee arrange-
ment (ff God himself. So the Apostle observes to the He-
brews, v. 4, No man taketlz this honour aulo himself} but lle
that z‘s‘calledqf God, as was Aaron. We learn, therefore,
from this word ὀικονομίας, that the Church is like a family3
that God is the master of this family3 that the apostles‚
the bishops, the. presbyters, and deacons are the servants
and ministers of God in carrying on the business of the
family.

Hence observe,

l. Since the Church is the household of God, no one
ought to exercise any function in it but by the legitimate
calling of God himself. Nou⁷ a legitimate calling is either
extraordinary, such as that of the Apostles 'was formerly.;

master.

Q. Since ministers are appointed in the Church accord-

what they both teach and do is not valid from their sole
command and mere arbitrary authority, but by the dele-

of God himself. For that which a minister does contrary
to the will of the Lord, can never stand good3 for he is

bound to dispense such things, and in such a manner as the
Lord hath directed.

3. Since in every arrangement and the management of
any family, it is requisite there should be order, not only
with respect to the service itself, but also with respect to
the servants themselves, if they are numerous; it is evident
that those are disturbers of the Church of God, and de-
