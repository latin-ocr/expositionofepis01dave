360 AN ssxrosvrloN OF s'r. PAUL’s Clmp. ii.

conclude from this place, that all wisdom and knowledge
reside in Christ sulgy'ectivelgy. I dare not reject this opi-
nion, since there is neither falsehood in it, nor does it depart
from the words themselves : But Ι think that the Apostle
rather had regard to the former, nor spake so much con-
cerning the wisdom with which Christ is wise‚ as concern-
ing that, by the apprehension of which, we become wise.

2. And it is also to be noted, that these words wisdom
and knowledge are not explained in the same manner by all.
Some would have that there is no difference between them,
but that they are introduced and repeated for the sake of
amplification only; as if the Apostle had said, that in
knowing Christ, we have the most absolute and perfect
knowledge. Others say, the term σοφια (wisdom) desig·
nated an acquaintance with God, cr divine things3 γνωςεως
(knowledge) denotes the comprehensim} of human affairs,
or of creatures. But there is a third opinion, which Ι pre-
fer: it is that which explains the former term (which they
render sapientia) to mean an acquaintance with those doc-
trines which relate to faith3 but the latter (scientia), the
understanding of those that relate to the. Christian life.
Wisdom, therefore, embraces the things to be l›elieved;
knowledge, the things to be done. Both these are known,
when Christ, or the mystery of Christ, is properly under-
stood.

In the last place, we must remark, that it is said these
treasures are not merely placed or situated in the know-
ledge of Christ, or the Gospel of Christ, but hidden. By
which word is intimated, that what is precious and magnifi-
cent in Christ, or the Gospel of Christ, is not conspicuous,
or directly meets the eyes of carnal men; but is so con-
eealed, that it is discovered only by those to whom God
has given a quick sight, i. e. spiritual eyes to see. So
Christ himself said, Matt xi. 25, 1 thanlc thee, Ο Father,
that thou hast lzidden, δὶα. And the Apostle, l Cor. i. 23,
shews that Christ is no treasure to carnal men, but an of-
fence and object of ridicule3 We preaclc Christ crucffied, to
the Jews α stumbling-bloclc, Sto. This opinion, therefore,
