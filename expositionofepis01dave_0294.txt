4. It is said, Such is the state of angels and of men in
happiness as no longer to require a preserving Providence3
for happiness (as Boethius, lib. 3, De consolat. defines it,)
is α slafe perfected by tlte assemblage of all good things : but
the power of self-preservation is one of- those good things
especially, without which all the rest are frail and uncer-
tain: therefore the spirits in blessedness have this power,
and so do not require other preservation.

We allow that happiness is a state of perfection, and
that among the assemblage of blessings in which it consists,
the power of preserving itself in this state of happiness
must be found. The blessed Spirits‚-theref01·e, have this
sels-preserving power, as far as they have the power of in—
separably cleaving to God; hut not so far, as that if they
were separated from Gocl, they could preserve either their
own happiness or existence. lf any onc wishes any thing
further on this subject, let him consult Aquinas, l quaest.

and also contra Gentiles lib. 3, cap. 645*

From what has been said we may gether the following
remarks for our own benefit.

1. For the support of our confidence3 for wc may rely
fearlessly on this Redeeiner‚ and the preciousness of his
blood, who is a person of such infinite power and majesty
that he did create all things, and still upholds all things,
which would otherwise relapse into nothing.

2. To produce within us humility. For if we cannot
retain our natural existence even for a moment without his
preserving power, how much less our supernatural and
freely given existence? With Gerson(Par.Q)I will unhesi-
tatingly assert3 In whatever degree α man is more aeeomplished
than ordinary in natural or grcztuilous enclowments; in the same
degree is lle more lz'ahle tofall short cmdfall away, when this
special sustentation by the arm of Christ is withdrawn. We
mayform a conjecture on this point from the case qf Luci er,

⁶* The Reader may profitably consult our own Hooker, who has much

that is very excellent, and quite to the point, on this and the preceding to-
pics, in his first Book of the ‘⁶ Ecclesiastical Polity.”
