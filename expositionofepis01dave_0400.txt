314 AN EXPOSITION οι· ST. PAUL'S Clmp.i.

oppression and set at liberty3 therefore, it best illustrates
the glory of God, and most correctly, in this respect, is it
called a gloriolas mystery.

On our part, moreover, it may be called α glorians mys-
tery, because it ensures to believers real and eternal glory3
nay more, by the power of faith it puts them into present
possession of it. On this account it is preferred to the
law of Moses, 2 Cor. iii. 7, 8, If tlze ministration of (leallz
was glorious, how shall not the ministration (ff the Spiric be
rather glorious? And in the Epistle to the Hebrews, xii. 18,
Ye areuot come to tlze mount that might be touched, and that
bur-ned witlz fire, nor wito bladeness, and daylcness, and tem-
pest; but με are come unio mount Zion, and tlze city of the
living God, tlze heavenly Jerusalem, and lo an imtzmzerable
company qf augels. To this glory the Gospel calls and con-
ducts those who are sanctified and faithful, and, therefore,
there is the best of reasons for its being called α glot-ivus
mystery.

Now there are two sorts of men which stand reproved by
this divine attribute: First, they who endeavour so to in-
terpolate and mutilate the doctrine of the Gospel, as well
nigh to obliterate the riches and glory of the divine compas-
sion contained in it. And here it is that the Papists have
sinned most grievously; ascribing, as they do, the power of
washing away sin and procuring salvation, to their own me-
rits and satisfactions, free-will, and other absurdities of
this sort, and thus concealing this glory of the compassion
and free mercy of God, which constitutes this mystery
glorious. For this mystery of the Gospel is no longer glo-
rious to God if we may be allowed to boast of our own
good works, and to obtain salvation through their merits.

They also are glanced at who, in the profession of the
Gospel, neither regard nor look for any thing better than
external peace, worldly honours, and temporal accommo-
dations of this kind. This mystery of the Gospel is indeed
fruitful, honourable, and glorious 3 but it promises fruits of
another kind, other honours, and glory of a very different
description. It brings with it fruits, not of money, but of
righteousness3 honours, not of the world, but of heaven3
