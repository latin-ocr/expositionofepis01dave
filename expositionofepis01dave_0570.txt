as α feast to tlte Lot-d throughout your generations for ever,
Exod. xii. 14. The same command is given concerning the
Sabbath, Exod.xxxi. 16. And of every other feast it is
said, Levit. xxiii. 21, It shall he a stalutefor ever in all your
dwellings throughout your generations.

Ianswer, That Hebrew word, Gnolam, which interpre-
ters sometimes render mer-nal, sometimes everlasting, and
sometimes cm age, denotes perpetuity either absolute, or for
a perz'od,· i. e. liinited according to the nature of the thing.
It (16110165 an absolute eternity, when it is predicated of
God, or of other eternal things: as when it is said, The
trullz of God abidetlzfor ever, 01· when God himself is called
etet-nal. It denotes α period, or α cz‘tcumscrz'bed perpetusty,
in regard to 1116 condition of the subject, when it is predi-
cated of things 111 their nature frail and mutable: As 111
Dent. xv. 17, concerning a servant who did not wish to go

he shall be thy seri-antfor ever. So l Sam. xxvii. 12, Achish
said concerning David, He lzatlz made his people utterly co
abhor him, therefore he shall be my servant sor ever. Latin
authors speak after the same manner. Thus Horace,

‘¹ Who 56115 1115 freedom in exchange sor gold,

(Freedom‚ for mines of wealth too cheaply sold‚)

shall make eterna! servitude his fate,

And feel a haughty master's galling weiglit.''

Francis's Hor. Ep. x. L. 1.

Thus the Schoolmen are accustomed to affirm that ungodly
rnen are justly punished 111 the eternity (ff God, because they
have sinned in sno merito, in their own eternity. In all these
places by the word εἰει-παῖ we are to understand nothing
else than the longest duration of a thing according to its
nature and condition. So, then, with respect 10 1116 fcasts
and other Jewish ceremonies, which God enjoined to be
observed for ever, that the eternity was not absolute, bnt
is to be received in a limited sense, according to the con-
dition of the snbjects. And this limitation extended to
1116 advent of Christ and 1116 revelation of the Gospel.
