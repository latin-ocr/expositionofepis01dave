148 AN EXPOSITION OF s'r. PAUL'S Chapst.

light, without this merciful acceptance. Woe to the com-
mendable life of man, ‘ff thou sg’ft it without mercy, says Au-
gustine, Confess. lib. ix. cap. 13. And the Psalmist,
cxliii. 2, Enter not intojudgment with thy servant, for inthy
sight shall nostesh bejzzstg'fi'ed. Beautifully writes the Apos-
tle to the Ephes. i. 5, 6, God hath adopted us according to
the good pleasure of his will. He hath accepled us by his
grace in the beloved.

These things being established concerning the Divine
operation and acceptance, we may deduce a few corol-
laries :

l. It is not in the power of fallen and corrupted man
to make himself meet for the participation of spiritual
gifts‚ such as grace, faith, blessedness: God alone, who
imparts the gffts, gives with them the disposition also for
their reception. Wherefore what some of the Schoolmen
assert about the preparations and dispositione which pro-
ceed from the power of free—will in the state of corrupt
nature. are to be received with cantion: Such as that say-
ing of Durandus, In Sentent. lib. i. qu. 6, Although it be
not in the power of man to produce in himself love or grace,
yet it is in- his power sofar to dispose himself, as that Gocl will
give grace to him. And that of Albert, Compend. v. 25*

¹· Albert, styled the Great, a German, of the Dominican Order, and a
follower of Peter Lombard ς “ a man,'' says hlosheim, ‘⁶ of vast abilities,
and an universal dictator in his time.” His celebrity, however, is so
clouded with the legendary tales related of his acquirements and perfor-
mances in occult philosophy, that it is impossible to say what portion of it
is dulymerited : and of the twenty-one folio volumes attributed to him, it
has since been ascertained that many pieces which are there inserted were
not composed by him. Still the distinction he obtained for his extensive ac-
quaintance with the subtle philosophy and obscure theology of the times
was so great, that, in 1248, he was called to Rome by Pope Alexander
IV. and appointed Master of the Sacred Palace (vide Note ’ᾖ p. 38). In
1260, he was elected Bishop of Ratisbon ; but finding his episcopal duties
inconsistent with his love of retirement and study, he resigned his Bishop-
ric, and returned to Cologne to enjoy the leisure of Monastic life. He was,
however, drawn from his retirement by Pope Gregory X. who sent him
into Germany and Bohemia to preach the Crusade. He afterwards attend-

ed the Council of Lyons, and then returned to Cologne, where lie remain-
ed until his death in 1280.
