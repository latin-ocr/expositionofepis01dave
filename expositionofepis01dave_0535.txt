Ver. 12. EPlSTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 449

to effect this habitual principle of grace in them, no sane
person will deny. Moreover, it is not necessary that the
sacraments, in that very moment in which they are adminis—
tered, should effect all those things which they represent3
nay, upon the concessions of the Schoolmen themselves,
A covenant admitting (ff delays is allowable when α bar is
placed in tlze very act qf undertaking it. But now the very
defect of reason in infants as to acting, is an impediment to
their possessing actual saith, or actual desire of mortifica-
tion. Besides, although saith and actual penitence are re-
quired from an adult before he receives the sign of the co-
vcnant‚ yet it is not required as to the act from the infants
of believers3 because to be in covenant is a sufficient rea-
son for receiving the sign of the covenant: but infants are ·
included in the same covenant with their parents3 I will be
the God (ff tlzee and of thy seed, Gen. xvii. 7. This we see
in Abraham, who first believed and afterwards was circum-
cised3 but his Son Isaac, inasmuch as he was already in
covenant, he circumcised before he was of age to believe.
This, in the case of the infants of Christians, is done duly
and after the example of the Apostles, who did not bap-
tize adults except they made a profession os faith3 but
when the parents embraced Christianity, then they bap-
tized their whole families, and no one is ignorant that (in
the Epistles) infants are also comprised under the name of
afamz'ly. The passages are mauifest3 Acts xvi. 15 and 33,
1 Cor. i. 16. ’

Let it suffice to have noticed these things about infant
baptism against the Anabaptists.
