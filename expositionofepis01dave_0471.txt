Ver. 7. EPISTLE To Tun COLOSSIANS. 3³85

of the good), that another sense is included in these words
in this place. Therefore I explain περισσεύοντες ἐν αὐτιῗ, feel-
ing assured that you abeund in that faith which rests on
Christ‘alone, i. e. that you are rich, overflow, and possess
abundantly all things necessary to salvation. Itis not,
therefore, to the. increase of our knowledge I refer this
abundance3 but to the thing known, viz. the doctrine of
the Gospel concerning Christ.

Never ought it to seem wonderful or nov-el that we explain
abozmcle'ng———knowing or determining that ye abound: for,
in the Holy Scriptures‚ words very often denote a supposi-
tion of our knowledge of those things which they really
signify. As 1 Cor. iv. 8, Ye arefnll, yse ανε, rich, με lmve
reigned as lcz'ngs without us ,· i. e. Ye think ye are full, ye are'
rich, ye have reigned, διο. And in Rom. v. 20, The law
entered that sin might aboena& i. e. that ye might know the
magnitude of sin. Therefore, Ι so explain abounding, in
this place, knowing‚ or determining with certainty that ye
abound.

Ι follow this interpretation, because it especially agrees
with the purpose of the Apostle's exhortation. For he
wishes them to remain rooted in the faith of Christ alone:
but that which especially conduces to their doing so is,
that they should make up their ininds that by this faith
in Christ they abeund, i. e. that they had all things which
are necessary to be known for salvation.

Moreover, this especially opposes the opinion of the
false tear-hers. For they thought that they had discovered
poverty‚ and defects, in faith and the doctrine of the Gos-
pel, and therefore they patched upon it philosophical spe-
culations, and Mosaic ceremonies‚ and innumerable other
traditions ε but, on the contrary, the Apostle says, we
almund in it, we have in that doctrine all abundance of
saving knowledge.

Lastly, this best connects with the following words, wiell
tlmnlcsgiving. For this ought especially to excite us to
gratitude, because in Christ alone God hath administered
to us abundantly all things necessary to salvation.

This sense of the words being granted, we learn that the
