lency of the things which are worshipped. There is a cer-
tain worship of civil subjection which is offered to a per-
son by reason of a particular eminence and dominion which
he hath‘ over another3 with this civil worship we worship
magistrates, parents, preceptors, &Q There is another
worship of moral reverence, which is offered to persons or
things on account of their excellence considered in them-
selves, by reason of virtue, station, or any dignity apart
from authority in the person honoured, or subservience in
the person honour-ing. We worship learned, pious‚ and
wise men with this moral worship, although we are not sub-
ject to them by any politieal subordination: we venerate
saints and angels with this same worship, yet in a higher
degree, because they are endowed with more excellent gifts,·
virtues, and graces : We honour them with love, not witlz ser-
vice. August. De vera relig. cap, 55. And, lastly, there
is the worship of sacred religion, or latria, which is ren-
dered to him alone whom we apprehend as the author of
creation and of our blessedness. Thus much concerning
the difference of worship.

2. Now let us shew that religious worship, whether it
be called latria or dulia, is to be given to God alone, not
to angels or saints*

It is shewn, first, from the interpretation of the word
itself, and that by the concurrence of the Heathen, the
Fathers, and Schoolmen. Religion, says the Orator, is
that which produces regard and service to some superior nature,
which he calls divina and elsewhere3 Religion is chat which
z's comprised in the pious worship of the gods. Lactantius, in
his Instit. lib. 4. cap. 29, remarks, We are te'ed and bound to
God, by che hond <ff piety, whence Religion itself derives its
name. So Augustine, De civit. Dei, lib. 10. cap. l. Ifwe
merely call it worship, it does not appear due to God alone: but
{f we more distinctly call it Religion, it signffies not any wor-
ship, but tlzatof G-od. So Aquinas, Q. 2. qu. 81. art. l,

'¹ For some readers it may perhaps be well to observe, that latria and
dulia are terms adopted by the Romish Church in reference to divine wor-
ship ; that latria means the highest kind of religious invocati0n‚ and dulia
is intended to designate what they regard of an inferior character.
