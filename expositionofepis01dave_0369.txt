Ver. 24. ErisTLE To 'rua COLOSSIANS. 283

it is no privilege of the Pope to distribute and dispense
this treasure, by his bulls‚ to individuals expressly named :
and that for the following reasons :—

1. The blood, and the passion of Christ, and the store
of his merits, is applied to particular persons by the sole
operation of the Holy spirit producing saith, and hy the
internal operation of saith laying hold on Christ3 but no
papal bulls produce faith, nor stir up a man to apprehend
its object3 therefore they apply neither the blood nor the
merits of Christ to rnen, nor are of any service in the re-
niission of sins. The Pope, then, can do no more for the
remission of sins than any other priest: but what is the
duty of ministers Paul teaches in 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in
Christ wconcilz'ng the world anto himself, ancl bath committed
meto ns the word of reconciliation. He did not grant th'e
power of remitting the punishment of men by bulls even
to the Apostles themselves3 but he commanded them, by
the word and preaching the Gospel, to encourage men to
seek for reconciliation and remissiori in Christ. Indul-
gences can be of no use to unbelievers, and to believers
they are unnecessary3 because their saith applies the me-
rits and sufferings of Christ to their souls.

2. The dispensing of Christ’s blood, and the actual ap-
plication of his saving merits to a particular person, is en-
trusted to no man who does not know the person to whom
those spiritual benefits are to be imparted3 but neither the
Pope, nor indeed any other mortal knows this3 for God
alone lcnows who are his.- therefore God alone bestows 111-
dulgences by tho application and acceptance of the suffer-
ings of Christ.

3. Real repentance and true contrition of beart, 111 con-
junction with true faith, is more effectual with God in ob-
taining perfect remission,-than any papal indulgence can
be3 for God himself is far more bountiful than any Roman
Pontiff: but, if we believe the Papists themselves, neither
the ordinary penitence of the faithful can obtain, nor is the
benevolence of God wont to grant, any other forgiveness
than from guilt only: it is not, therefore, very likely, that,
the Pope by virtue of his indulgences should bc able fo
absolve a man sorthwith from the penalty.
