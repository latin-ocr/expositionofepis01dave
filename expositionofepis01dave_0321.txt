Ver.20. EPISTLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 235

by our sins, he will call to remembrance his fatherly pity
and compassion3 and that, indeed, because the reconcilia-
tion is accomplished.

2. In the second place it is to be inquired‚ By whose
decree, ‘counseh and authority this work of reconciliation
hath been undertaken and accomplished? We ans'wer at
once, that it was done by the authority and appointment of
God the Father. This we gather from the connection of
this verse with the preceding3 It leatlz pleased him (that is
to say, the Father) that z'n Christ should allfuluess (ΜΘΗ,-
And by him to effect the reconciliation. Here, therefore, it is
also proper to substitute that word '2130‘an it pleased the

In many other places the work of reconciliation is ascri-

Jehovah himself had ordained and called Christ to this
work of reconciliation, and strengthened and upheld him
during his whole accomplishment of human salvation. It
is evident, therefore, that God was the primary author of
this reconciliation, and was induced to devise this plan of
our redemption entirely from his own good pleasure, and
from free love. The Apostle here employs this particular
term ἐυδόκησε, It pleased him well. And in Jeremiah xxxi. 3,
we read, I leave loved thee wille an everlastz'ng love. And in
all parts of Scripture, this gratuitous love of God is de-
