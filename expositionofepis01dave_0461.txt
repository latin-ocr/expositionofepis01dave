Ver. ὃ. EPISTLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 375

duly; and eompels the negligent and refractory to perform
their duty. Concerning this the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor.
xiv. 40, Let all things be done decently ancl in order. For
this he commends his Timothy, Epis. i. cap. 3. He now,
therefore, praises the Colossians because this Church dis-
cipline flourished among them, which, if neglected, all
things would be in shameful confusion, sedition, errors,
and crimes.

Lastly‚ he comprehende agreement and unity in religion
under the word order.- for τάξις is a military term, and de-
notes a compact body of soldiers marshalled in due order:
Thus, then, the Apostle, when he says that he beheld their
order, intiinates that he regarded them as a well arranged
phalanx of soldiers, united and cleaving together in the
unity of the saith, and therefore invincible.

Hence we may lay it down,

1. That there is nothing more beautiful or useful than
order, nothing more shameful or injurious than confusion,
Admirably does Nazianzen write. concerning this matter,
Orat. 26. Where order prevaz'ls, there beauty shines &rightly ;
where there is want oforder, there arz'se in the air storms, upon
the land commocions, by sea inwzdations, z'n cilios seditions, in
bodies distempeis, and among souls sins. Order comprehends
celestial ancl terrestrial tlzings; there is order among rational
beings, order among irrational ones ; order among angels, order
in the θέαι-5, order ιή all tlzings. No wonder, since God hirn-
self is not the author of confusion, but of harmong, and
that especially in the churches of the saints. 1 Cor. xiv.
33.

2, Since orderis the arrangementqf equals and zmequals,
clistributing their proper places to every one ,· they who intro-
duce equality of ecclesiastical ministers subvert order.
For it is the polity of Cyclops, not ecclesiastical disci-
pline, where no one recognizes another&

3. Since from that order which flourishes among the
people, their pastors derive such joy, it follows that they
who despise and trample upon the legitimate orders of
the Church, undeservedly vex and injure with great sorrow
