72 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL’s Clzap. i.

too much desire for himself spiritual good things3 but
sensible and transitory ones he may; and in this consists
that love which is to be blamed.

3. Inow come to the third object of love, which our
present design has chiefly in view3 and this is that which
is near to us (as Augustine says), i. e. om· rceiglzbour.*

But a person is called a neighbour not from consangui-
m’ty only, but from a mutual participation of reason, as the
gloss has it. So also Justin Martyr, A man’s neighbour is
nothing else, but α being participating in a similar condition
and in rationalfacullies.† But this must be observed by
the way, that a neighbour is loved by us with true
love, not simply as he is a partaker of rational nature, but
so far as that rational nature may be a partaker of the di-
vine blessedness 2 for love is founded in the mutual parti-
cipation of the divine fruition‚ as was before observed.
Among neighbours therefore, i. e. among men, the especial
objects of our love are holy men, as the Apostle both here
and elsewhere teaches3 as in the Epistle to the Galatiam,
vi. 10, Let us do good meto all men, especially unco them wlco

⁸ A couplet from Arxgustine, which it is said he caused to be inscribed
upon his table, is worthy of being cited here ς it is a practical testimony

that Ιιε was not actuated by the ‘⁶ bitter and unchristian spirit'’ recently at-
tributed to those supposed to hold Calvinistic tenets :—

“ Far from this table be the worthless guest
Who wounds another's fame though but in jest.''

-ἱ- Justin, or ιῙιιειὶηιιε, surnamed the Martyr3 one of the earliest writers
in the Christian Church, was born at Neapolis, the ancient Sichem of Pa-
1estine, in the province of Samaria. His father Priscus was a Greek Gen-

tile, and he himself was deeply versed in the Platonic Philosophy, when he
was led by a conversation with a Christian convert, to inquire into the me-
rits of that Religion which he afterwards embraced in 132, and supported
both by preaching and writing until he was called upon to seal its truth with
his blood. He was beheaded‚ after having been scourged, according to the
imperial edict, in the reign of M. Aurelius, A.D. 165. Among his works
(a good summary of which has lately been given to the public in a small
8vo. volume, by Bishop Kaye), the best known are his ‘ Dialogue with
Trypho the .]ew,’ and his first and second Apology for the Christians3 the
former of which he presented to Antoninus Pius, and the latter to his suc-
cessor, Aurelius. Specimens from these will be seen as we proceed, and

evince the power of the Gospel‚ in the ennobling of the mind, above all
Philosophy.
