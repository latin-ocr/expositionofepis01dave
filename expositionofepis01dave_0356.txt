yourself, are now living in bonds in consequence of your
professing and preaching the Gospel. The Apostle, there-
fore, anticipates this objection, and argues, that because
he is now enduring persecution on account of the Gospel,
they, for that very reason, ought to persevere ln it; for
unless its doctrines were both true and saving, he never
would undergo such numberless inconveniences for the
promulgation of it.

Here, therefore, two points are to be considered z—How
the Apostle conducts himself under these afflietions;
namely, with a placid, and even a joyfnl mind, I rejoice in
‘my Szgffbringsforyozc. What reasons he had for this joy
and for such enduranee : and he assigns three,

2 Tim. ii. 10 ; and 2 Cor. xii. 15. Most wz'llz'ngly wz'llIspend

from this disposition in St. Paul, we infer,

l. That the ministers of the Gospel ought to be ever
ready to bear their cross z lee servant z's not greater than
lzz's Lorcl ; ff they lzave persecutecl me, they will also persecute

this Christian warfare3 and the devil is sure to harass the

leaders more than the private soldiers. Cyprian speaks
