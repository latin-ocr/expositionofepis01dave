therefore upon the material it depends for ils dm'czhiz'ily.
Now to apply this to our argument: God is the cause of
things, not only as to theirformation, but as to their being:
In him we live, and move, ancl have our being, Acts xvii. 28.
Therefo‘re all things depend upon him, not only as to their
first production‚ but as to the continuance of their es-
sence; since he is the cause both (ff the being and also of
theformation of all things.

To confirm these arguments I will adduce but two pas-
sages of scripture: The first from John v. 17, lisy Father
worheth hitherto, and I ποι-[ε. Which passage interpreters
apply to this continual operation of God and of Christ in
the preservation and government of the creatores. For
God rested on the seventh clay from making new creatures3
but he never rests or ceases from. the preservation of, and
administration to, the creatores that are made, The other
authority is taken from He'o. i. 3, where Christ is spoken of
as npholding all things by the word of his power. Which ex-
pression intimates that the Divine power of Christ is the
support* and the foundation, as it were, of all crea-
tures, which would presently fall at once into annihi-
lation unless sustained by him.

And now let us draw some testiinonies froin the Fathers :

1. Justin Martyr, De decret. Aristot. reprehens. says,
As that which sprung into existence never would hace existed
unless God had prononnced his Fiat.- so neither would they con—
tinue in existence, unless the same God had commanded those
things which are not snhject to dewy, lo stand fin· ever ; and
that those things which spring ιφ and deca-is, should constantly
increase and mulliply. Here, by the way, I may be per-
mitted to remark, what I had before passed over, viz.
That Christ not only sustains and preserves every indivi-
dual thing, by the virtue which fiows from him, which we
have already likened to a continued work of creation: but
also, that by virtue ofthis primary messing, he propagates
the various species of things by successive generations.

⁸ The Fulcmm, as it were; as a friend remi-red, ⁶ Here is the very
desideratum of Archimedes!
