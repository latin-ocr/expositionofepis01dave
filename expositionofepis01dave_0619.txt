among men, he lays up to himself merits of supererogation ;
he finally makes God a debtor to him. And this mll-
worship. is very pleasing to human nature. For since there
is a double will-worship; one, when a person of his own
accord chooses any creature to whom he offers the worship
due to God3 the other, when he worships the true God,
but not in that manner, neither by those acts whereby he
hath defined his worship, but by others, chosen of his own
will: the former species of will-worship is condemned by
almost all, because it clearly detracts from God what is
his own, and transfers it to the creature3 but this other is
commended by many because it seems to offer to God what
is his own, and something beyond it; it has,'therefore, as.
it were, the appearance of a certain free-will offering. This

remember, That God, indeed, loves the willing worship-
per, i. e. him who joyfully and willingly does that which he
hath commanded to be done; but that he hates will-wor-
ship, i. e. those acts which a‘re offered to him as the imme-
diate worship of God, when they were not prescribed and
commanded by him for this end : for this is to go α wkoriug
wiell, their own inventions, Psalm cvi. 39. We must also
kn0w3 that abstinence from certain meats, celibacy, volun-
tary poverty, and other things of that kind, in which im-
postors place this voluntary worship of God, and I know
not what merit of supererogation, are nothing else than
