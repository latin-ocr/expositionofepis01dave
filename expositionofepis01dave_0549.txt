monial,· whereas the Apostle wished to comprehend both.
For the benefit of the hand-writing being blotted out has
respect to all, as well Gentiles as Jews : therefore it is pro-
per to‘understand the hand—writing to be of that kind,
whereby, in some measure, all are bound : but the Gentiles
were never bound to the ceremonia} law.

I therefore explain the lcatzd-writing in ordinances to mean
the force of the moral law binding to perfect obedience‚
and condemning for any defect thereof; laden with the ce-
remonial rites as skirts and appendages. The Apostle,
then, states two things3 viz. that the law itself as to the
power of binding and condemning, is abrogated3 and the
rites or ceremonies, in which was founded, as it were, a
public confession and confirmation of this obligation and·
merited condemnation, are, at the same time, abolished.
And this best agrees with the Apostle's design: For he
here contends against those who urged the Mosaic rites,
and especially circumcision: and he concludes, that that
hand-writing being done away, the rites also in which the
acknowledgment of the debt was contained, ought likewise
to be done away. Thus much concerning the hand-writing
in ordinances.

2. We must explain how this hand-writing in ordinauces
is said to be against us ,· and a little after, to be contrary to
us: And since as we have interpreted the hand-writing in
ογᾱὶηαηεεε, of both laws, the moral and ceremonial, these
things are also to be applied to each.

As to the moral law3 that is, indeed, in itself holyjmt,
and good‚· nevertheless, by accident it is become hostile
and deadly to us, namely‚ by the introduction of sin and
our corruption ; (as the Apostle shews, Rom. vii. 12, 13.)
1. Because the law propounds decrees plainly contrary to
human nature: for that is spiritual, but we are carnal, sold
under sin, Rom. vii. 14. 2. Because it arraigned‚ and con-
victs, and brings us in guilty of sin: for to summon to
judgment, and to arraign of guilt, is the office of an ad-
versary3 and this the law does in the tribunal of every
man’s conscience: For by the law is tlze knowledge qf sin,
