Ver.22. EPISTLE το THE coLossiANS. 257

Itis not necessary to repeat what we said about the
death of Christ when explaining the 20th verse. From
these words of the Apostle we shall note only two things
subversive of the foolish notions of certain heretics :

l. That the body of Christ was fleshly, i. e. truly hu-
man, not heavenly, or a phantasm, as Marcion and Valen-
tinus formerly fancied, whom Tertullian clearly refutes, If
the flesh of Christ were a phantasm, then also all his worlcs
which he did by theflesh were so. The jor-m of his existence
was suppositious ; the act was suppositions. He was an ima-
ginarzs taor-her, and his worhs were imaginaris. And what they
commonly adduced in support of this error, viz. that a
fleshly body is unworthy of God, the same Father well
clears away, by answering·‚ That there is no substance worthy
jbr God to assume ; but whatever he shall assume, he himself*
renders womhy. Which may be illustrated by the simili-
tude of a king taking a consort to himself from among his
subjects.

2. That Christ himself truly suffered and underwent death
in this flesh. Which refutes the absurd heresy of Basilides,
who taught that Simon the Cyrenian, being transformed into
the. resemblance of Christ, was crucified by the Jews3 but
that Christ himself stood by in the likeness of Simon and de-
rided the Jews. Perhaps these extraordinary assertions of
heretics do not require a refutation 3 for they who thus argue
that all things are imaginary, are themselves in truth ima-
ginary Clzrz'stz‘ans, as Tertullian, cap. 27, learnedly argues
against the Valentiniansfiss Thus much concerning the deli-

there publicly with Valentinus and other heresiarchs. He turned his pen
against all the internal and domestic enemies of the Church, by attacking
the monstrous errors which were adopted by many of the primitive Chris-
tians, as appears by his five books against heresies, which are considered as
one of the most precious monuments of ancient erudition ; yet, though se-
veral editions of them have been given in Greek and Latin, no translation
has appeared in our own language. Irenaeus suffered death in the fifth per-
secution of the Christians under Septimus Severus, A.D. 202. He was a
very humble, modest man, and amidst all his zealous exertions for Chris-
tian truth‚ evinced that he waS, agreeable to his name,—“ a lover of peace.'’

'¹‘ Basilides, referred to in this Section, was an heresiarch of the second
century, the chief of the Egyptian Gnostics; a species of arrogant Philo-
