Ver. 6. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 93

But here a doubt is started by some, who think the Ges-‘-
pel could not have spread into all the world in so short a
space of time, as for instance, forty or fifty years. They
also urge that objection, that many nations‚ nay, another
hemisphere is now discovered, which was unknown in the
times of the Apostles.

Now to this it may be replied, first3 That expression into all
the world is to be explained (by synecdoche) for the greatest
part of the world. For we must not think that the Apostles
penetrated into all the corners of the known world; but
into the most noted provinces, and especially preached the
Gospel in the great cities, i. e. they diffused it far and
wide. So Luke ii. l, There went out α decree from Caesar
Augustus that all the world should be taased, i. e. all the pro-
vinces subjected to the Roman Empire. So John xii. 19,-
All the world is gone after him, i. e. men of all kinds indis-

criminatel .
Set-onds} the Gospel is come into all the world, inasmuch

as a school of Evangelical doctrine is open to all the
world, although it may not be preached in particular places.
Itis opposed, therefore, to the doctrine of Moses, which
was open to one nation only, whereas access may be had
to the Gospel for all nations. Whence that saying of the
Apostle, Titus ii. ll, The grace of God that briugeth salva-
tion halla appeared to all men. Not that the preachers of
the Gospel, bestirring themselves in all directions, could
preach to all and every one3 but the preaching of Gospel
grace is offered to all and every one without distinction
of nations.

But as to what is objected in the last place about the New
world, viz. that the Gospel was never known to those people,
since they were unknown in the times of the Apostles3 I

gustine was known there ; for his Queen Bertha was a Christian, and had
a Christian Chaplain about her person ; and the arrival of Augustine was
soon succeeded by the too connnon accompaniments of the Roman creed-
tyranny and persecution. How small a portion of Britain is indebted to
Gregory may be seen, among other writers, in the learned ‘⁶ Defence of
English Or‹lers‚'’ by Mason, translated by Lindsey. “ Adams's Religious
World Displayed,'' may also be consulte-d with satisfaction, vol. i. p. 393.
