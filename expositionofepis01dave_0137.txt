Ver. 2. urim-LE To THE CoLosslANs. 51 ’

that it is a remnant of sin ε they leave a believer in perpe-
tual doubt3 we say that he at length breaks through it, and
is convinced by faith that his sins are remitted, not by
conjecture, or hope only, into which, as the Papists sup-
pose, deception may enter. But that, whilst we are in
this frail body, faith may abide in a man who is subject to
frequent doubts, is evident from Matth. xiv· 31, O thou of
little saith, wherefore didst thou doubt ?—This the Schoolmen
also grant. In a believer, αη idea may spring up in opposition
to that which he mostfirmly holds, Aquinas, De fide, art. 1.
And in another place, The certainty sffaith implies the sted-
fastuess of adhesion, not the quiescence of the intellect. So
Dur‚andus Lib. iii. dist. 23, qu. 7, Faith may be subjected to

some degree of doubt, andz yet be sound.
It is not, therefore, necessaiy, that the assurance of faith ·

And these are Bellarmin’ s extraordinary conclusives,
with which he opposes the assurance of saith, conceding
in the mean time the assurance of hope to the faithfu13
concerning which distinction I shall also add a few remarks,
and conclude.

I ask of the Papists, then, whether they mean human
hope, i. e. hope arising from probable conjectures and the
deduction of human reason3 or divine and scriptural hope,
i. e.a virtue inspired by the Holy Spirit. If they say that
the godly are assured of grace and the remission of sins
by human hope, they allow nothing more to the godly, than
what the unbeliever may have; if by inspired hope, let
them hear their own friend Durandus‚* Lib. 3 : Thac which
depensis upon inspired hope cannot but come to pass. Scripture
also assigns the same certainty to this hope as to saith.
Rom. viii. 24, We are saved hy hope; and xv. 13, The God
(ψ’ hope fill you with all joy, aud peace in believing, that-qe
may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
Faith, therefore, is the eye of this hope3 and this hope is
excited and established by the Holy Spirit, whose gift it
