Ver. 16. EPJSTLE To Tur. cotossmns. 187

ren, and the first-born of the flock are of the flock : so the
first—born of every creature is of the number of the crea-
tures. But in the passage before us, we must understand Y
no nurnbering of him among the creatures, but only a pre-
cedency to thern. In the case of first-born, they vvho are
second-born have the sarne nature with the first3 because
they take their origin from the same person : But Christ is
so termed thefirst-born, that he is also the only begotten:
for he alone is begotten of God the Father ς creatures are
not begotten, but created by God. Therefore the first born
of every creature, signifies nothing else than begotten be-
fore any created thing.

Christ is the true God, because begotten not made3 be-
cause begotten before every creature. For whatever exists
is either Creator or creature. ’

Verses 16, 17.

For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalt'tt'es, or powers: all
things were created by him andjbr him.

And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

The Apostle proceeds in describing the Son of God by
a comparison with the creatures ςῚ and proves and illustrates
what he had laid down in the preceding verse, viz. that
Christ was the image (gf God, and the first· born (ff'every crea-
ture; in other words, that he is the Son of God according
to nature, begotten of him before any creature was made,
i. e. from all eternity. This he proves by reasoning from
the nature of cause and effect: and he shews that Christ
is the efficient, the preserving, and final cause of all crea-
tion; and on that account prior both in dignity and time
to every creature. And this argument he illustrates from
the various divisions of creation. But each of these will

be more conveniently discussed by following the order of
the context.
