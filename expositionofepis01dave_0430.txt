2. The care and solicitude of a faithful Minister is not

lightened, but is increased, if at any time he should be
withdrawn from his flock. For he who is absent in body
ought always to be present with the flock in spirit, and to
help them in the meanwhile by his prayerS‚ and by any
other means, with all his might.

3. Also it behoves him, with Paul, to exert himself to
the utmost‚ that from his deeds all should understand that

We have now gone through the first part of the Exor-
dium, which consisted of a narrative proposition3 for the
Apostle relates in it how great a conflict he had sustained,
that he might retain the Colossians‚ Laodiceans, and other

the Gospel, against all the machinations and deceptions of
seducers. ⁷

We now come to the second part of the introduction;
a statement of successive reasons of the actions and pur-
poses of the Apostle. For he accumulates many argu-
ments, from which he proves that his advice in persuading
them to constancy in the doctrine they had received, was ’
excellent, and that they would best consult their own sal-
vation by following it, i. e. by perseverance, for these have
a mutual connexion.
