concludes, whatever good is necessary to the pious shall
be bestowed upon them by God3 How much more shallyour
Father wito is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
Matth.,vii. ]l.—Let these things suffice concerning the
fountain of grace, viz. God.

Andfrom the LordJesas Christ] The Apostle here points
out the charmel of grace, viz. Jesus Christ, the Mediator
between God and men. God the Father himself' 1s the
fountain of grace3 but he chooses that it should be de-
rived to men through and for the sake of his Son: For as
by the first Adam 5111 15 derived to those who, after the
flesh, are descended from him; so by the second Adam,
viz. Christ, grace is derived to those who are spiritually
regenerate. Therefore Christ is said to convey grace to·
his people, either by the efficacy of his operation—or the
benefit of his intercession-—or the merit of his passion.
As he is the Head of the Church, it is his peculiar office
effectually to quicken his members, and to communicate
grace, i. e. spiritual life and motion to them. Being a

offered himself a sacrifice acceptable to God, he merito-
riously acquired the favour and grace of God for the
Church. Hence it is that in the Holy Scriptures all grace
and spiritual blessedness is set forth as given to us in
Christ: as in Ephes. 1. 3, 4, Blessed be the God and Falher
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiri-
tual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath
chosen us in him bejhre thefozmdatiorz (ff the world, that we

The Lord] Christ is designated by the relation which
he bears to us3 for he is Lord of us, and indeed of all
creatures. And this title belongs not only to the divine
nature, but also to his assumed nature: For God the
