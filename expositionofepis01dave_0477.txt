literature is cm lzelp to every department iu lise? Ilow will
‚you reject secular studies, without which [ltere cannot be (livine
ones? , Tertul. De idol. If, therefore, the Apostle had
condemned and rejected philosophy, lie would verily have
rejected the light of reason, and would have cast great in-
jury upon God, the author of it. As often, then, as what
rel-ates to human and eternal affairs is slighted and rejected
by divines‚ it is to be understood, not of true and genuine
philosophy, but of the errors and fancies of philosophers.
For tares are sown in philosophy as they are in our religion:
and truth is nearly excluded from it by the pernicious
things diffused in it. To conclude then, in a word, If the
errors of philosophers‚ or their crabbed subtilties, are
marked out under the term philosophy, then we are free to

mother of philosophy, is always found vain and deceilsul
when carried beyond its proper hounds, that is, when it
attempts to determine concerning those things which can-
not be judged of by tlze criterion of natural reason3 and of
this kind are those which concern tho worship of God and
the salvation of men. Philosophy is, therefore, to be lis-
tened to when it pronounce's about things subject to itself,
according to the light of right reason: but when it would
determine concerning human justification, reconciliation
with God, the mode of Divine worship, or of other matters
relating to faith, it is to be exploded3 because, in those
things which are beyond the grasp of reason, and depend
wholly on the revealed will of God, it brings nothing solid
or true, but betrays itsell' to be altogether rain and deecit-
