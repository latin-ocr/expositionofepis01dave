the Colossians may be retained and confirmed in the true
doctrine, and fortified against novel corruptions.

Now from these remarks it, is easy to reduce the sum of
the whole controversy to two points. First, that in Christ
alone, according to the Gospel doctrine, we have every
thing sufficient to salvation. Secondly, whatever tradi-
tions, ceremonies, and philosophical speculations are ob-
truded in the business of salvation‚ in addition to Christ,
are altogether vanity and imposture. These propositions
the Apostle so treats through this whole Chapter, that 116
does not dismiss the one before he proceeds to the other;
but indiscriminately and alternately, and often by varied
turns, he lays down, proves, and illustrates sometimes the
one, and sometimes the other. And it seems to me that
the Apostle adopts this method with the design that by
frequent discussion and repetition of both, he may fix each
of them deeply in the minds of Christians.

Finally, we have to speak of the division of this Chapter
into its members3 and it seems that the whole may be aptly
divided into four parts:

l. The exordium or preface, comprised in the first seven
verses.

2. The proposition of the subject to be treated, briefly
laid down in the cighth verse.

3. The confirmation of the Apostle’s judgment, extend·-
ed as far as to the seventeenth verse. Ἴ

4. The conclusion of the question, amplified and illus-
trated, to the end, as is common in conclusions.

OF THE EXORDIUM.

Let us now enter upon a view of the Exordium, compre-
hended (as I have stated) in the seven first verses: and
that consists of three parts3

l. In a narrative proposition, in which 116 shews both
his conduct and his mind towards the Colossians3 in the
first verse.

2. The statement of his reasons or the occasion; in
which he gives many reasons for his procedure, and propo-
sition ς from the first verse to the sixths
