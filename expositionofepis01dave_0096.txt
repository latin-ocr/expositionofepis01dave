10 AN EXPOSlTlON oF ST. PAUL’s (s'ltap. i.

of Peter alone, because supreme and universal power was
given to Peter as to an ordinary Pastor-,r who should have
successors3 but to the other Apostles, as to delegateS, who
should not. The Pope of Rome is therefore alone the

Apostolic Pontiffi his only the Apostolic See, and his office
that of an Apostle-

But on the contrary, the nature of an Apostle demands
that a man be immediately called by God to that office ς
that he be also instructed in evangelical truth immediately,
by the infallible inspiration of the Holy Spirit: but this is
more than the advocates of the Papacy themselves dare
arrogate to the Pope. He is not immediately called by
God, but chosen by the Cardinals, and that very often
through the intervention of intrigue and the basest fraud.
His knowledge of sacred learning (if he has any) is ac-
quired by study and industry, not inspired like that of the
Apostles. Therefore although they may call him an Apos-
tle, we shall conclude with Tertullian, advers. Marc. lib· l,
lee name z's assigned in moclcery to him to whom the natare im-
plied in the name is denied.

Bellarmin was a Jesuit of Tuscany raised first byClementVIII.‚ in 1599, to a
Cardinalate, and afterwards to the Bishopric of Capua3 which See he re-
signed to be near the Pope’s person, and devote himself entirely to the af-
fairs of the church. He died in 1621, in his seventy-first year ς “ bequeath-
ing one half of his soul‚'' says Du Pin, “ to the Virgin, and the other to
Jesus ChristP’ thus affording a melancholy testimony of the power with
which the superstition of the Church of Rome enchains her members: for
this same strenuous defendet of the doctrines of his Church, iu the tran-
quillity of private meditatum, comes to this conclusion in his book, De just.
lib. v. c. 7. prop. 3, “ Because of the uncertainty of our own righteousness,
and the danger of vain-glory‚ it is the safest way to place our entire trust
in the alone mercy and benignitv of God.” His devotional writings evince
him to have been a man of undoubted piety; and, at his death, so impress-
ed were the people with the idea of his sanctity‚ that it was necessary to
place guards to keep off the crowds which pressed round to touch his body,
or procure some relic of his garments.

³* It is necessary for the reader, not versed in technical terms, to bear in
mind here the Ecclesiastical meaning of the word “ Ordiuary.” Williams,
in his ‘⁶ Laws of the Clergy‚'’ thus defines it: “ Ordinary, ordinarius (which
is a word we have received from the Civil law) is he who has the proper and
regularjurisdictiom as of course and of common right3 in opposition to
persons who are extraordinarily appointed.”
