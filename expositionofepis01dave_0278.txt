The Apostle, however, testifies of these very works, that
they were created by Christ; and God himself pronounced
that they were in their kind very good, Gen. i. Nor is it
true that a thing which is inferior to another, is therefore
bad and imperfect, provided it possess all those properties
which belong to its species. Therefore, although earthly
and material substances may be inferior to the heavenly
and spiritual, yet are they in their kind good, and worthy
of Christ as their Creator. Even this very world, in that
it consists of both substances, is in reality more complete
than it would have been, if containing the invisible alone.

Fourthly‚ Of the Sadducees and Atheists‚ who reject in-
visible substances altogether; for they neither admit the
existence of angels or immortal souls. But these rob

'⁸' ,Marcion was a heresiarch of the second century, born at Sinopia, a
town of Paphlagonia, upon the Euxine: he was the son of a Bishop of that
place, and being excommunicated by his father for an act of immorality, he
went to Rome, joined the heretic Cerdon, about the year 143ς and these
two erected, on the foundation of the GnostIcs, a structure of considerable
extent, embracing those doctrines adverted to by our Author, with others
of an extraordinary character; and they were soon spread over ltaly, Egypt,
Palestine, Syria, and the adjacent parts. Marcion seems to have been the
chief promulgator of their opinions, and gave the denominatim] to the sect.
This heresy may be seen more at large, together with a refutation of the
various notions it comprises, in Bishop Kaye's Early History of the
Church.

The Manichaeans were a sect which arose in the latter half of the next
century 3 so called from the opinions they derived from LManes, or issani-
chaeus—a Persian, and educated among the Magi, being himself one of that
number before he professed to have embraced Christianity, which he sadly
corrupted ς and spread the seeds of his heresy, or rather of his motley mix-f
ture os some of the doctrines of Christianity with the ancient philosophy
of the Persians, principally in Arabia, Egypt, and Africa. Resides incula
cating the dogmas of the two eternal principles of light and darkness, so
prevalent among the Magi, and the other notions opposed by our Expositor,
Manes represented himself as the Comforter promised by Christ; not iden-
tifying him, as our Lord does, with the Holy Spirit, but understanding an
Apostle sent by the Spirit, to complete what the Saviour had left irnper-
fect. The inquisitive Reader, who wishes for more particular informatiou
respecting these men and their various notions, will find much curious and
interesting matter about both in ssower's “ Lives of the Popes.'’
