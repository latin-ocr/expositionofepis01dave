Ver. 18. EPlSTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 221

It is not my purpose to heap together more arguments,
or refute those of Bellarmin. I will only add some testi-
monies extracted from the Fathers and the Schoolmen,
that from them ye may be able to see clearly how entirely
these no-vices, the Jesuits, have departed from the truth of
the Scriptures, from the authority of the Fathers, and
from the doctrine of the ancient Schoolmen.

1. Clemens, Strom. 7, cap. 5, sayS, that the Church is
