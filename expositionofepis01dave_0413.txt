Ver. 29. EpisT-LE To THE COLosSIANS. 327

celibacy‚ and poverty, and obedience to the monkish rules,
but in the' observance of the Divine precepts. VVhence
also Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom. 7, says, that there is as
muclz perfection to befomzd in the coqjugal as z'n the monastic
lffe.²'“ W‘e therefore conclude, that the perfection of which
the Apostle is here speaking. does not consist in monastic
observances, but in saith, in charity, and 111 sanctity of
life3 in all which he who has the greater firmness, ardour,
and strength, is to be accounted the most perfect.

Verse 29.
Wleerezmto I also labour, strivz'ng according to llis working,
wlzz'clc worlcetlz in me miglztz'ly.

The Apostle amplifies his ininistry by a twofold argu-
ment: l. By his great labour, which he intimates under
the words labouring and striving. 2. By the effectual as·
sistance of Christ, which he expresses in adding, according
to his working, which workctlz z'n me mightily. He employs
both these arguments for confirming the Colossians in the
doctrine of the Gospel. For if Paul propagated this doc-
trine with all diligence, it ought also to bind the Colossians
with equal constancy : If Christ promoted this doctrine by
Divine aid, the Colossians ought to adopt the same as the
word of God.

Wherezmto I also labour, nomos] This Greek word does
not simply mean to labonr, but to labom· vehemendy, and even
to weariness. He therefore shews, first, from the labour
annexed to it, both the difficulty and the dignity of his
ministry: for a difficulty which arises from labour increases
its value.

⁸ Clemens 111 his 3d Strom. refutes the notions of the Marcionites about
abstinence from Mari-inge, from the saying of St. Paul, l Tim. iv. 1-3,
“ that those who forbid marriage propagate the doctrine of devils :'' and
also by the example of Peter and Philip, who were both married and had

children.
