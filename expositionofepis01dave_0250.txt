164 AN EXPOSlTION OF ST. PAUL'S (lhap. i.

as he offered and gave a sufficient ransom for all 3 but in
him the elect and faithful alone have effectual redemptioni,
because they alone are in him.

Hence we learn that no one bath, or can have, any fruit of
the redemption procured by Christ, unless he be in Christ.
But we are engrafted in Christ through faith by the Holy
spirit. Therefore salvationis not derived to us unless from
Christ our Head3 for when he becomes our Head, sind we
his membcrs, then we are in him, then his saving virtue
extends to us 3 but not before: For he is the »Saviom- qs his
body, Ephes. v. 23.

Here also vve must briefly resolve a doubt. For, when
the Apostle says, In whom we have redemption, viz. we
Christians‚ through the one oblation of the Son of God
our Redeemer3 it may, I say, be asked, Whether the
Fathers under the Old Testament enjoyed this redemption'?
Christ not being then born, not to say offered, for the ex-
piation of the sins of men.

We answer, the faithful under the Old Testament en-
joyed redemption in Christ through his blood which was
to be shed, like as we have through his blood having been
shed z because this sacrifice of Christ had a saving effica-
cy, not only by the actual offering, but by the eterna] de-
cree of God, and the eternal efficacy of the same sacrifice,
as well before as after it was offered. Jesus Christ the some

God, had Redemption even as we under the Gospel. Abra-
ham saw the day of Christ and icas glad, John viii. 56. He
saw it, not by carnal but spiritual vision. Augustine, and
the rest of the Fathers concur in this most true opinion.
