Ver. 8. EPISTLE ‘ro THE COLoss1ANs. 403

patiou about human traditions always begets ignorance
and contempt of the Divine precepts‚ Matth. xv. 6. It
might be proper here,- therefore, to discuss this sink of
Papistical traditions3 but I had rather ye should hear an
inquiry concerning this matter from some one among them-
selves than from rne. Gerson, part. l, De nuptiis Christi
et Eccl. asks, W'lzat means snclz α multitude of constitutions
whilst the Gospel is neither known nor regarded? Lec the
Gospel be in tltefirst place known and maintained. And, De
vita spirit. coral. 14. part. 3, Such is the multitude of this
kind of constitutions, that ff they were lcept in their rig0ur‚

And thus ye have what the Apostle would understand
under the name of traditions; how far they may be ap*

and assigned a certain portion of the Divinity to each of
these, and, consequently, a part of the Divine worship.
Therefore, both Augustine, in Epist ad Galat„ and some
from among modern interpreters, think the doctrine of the
worship of creatures to be glanced at in this passage. But
Irather embrace the interpretation of those who under-
stand by tlze rudiments ‘f tlte world, those introductory les-
sons by which God instructed the Jewish church3 namely,
the Mosaic rites, the legal ceremonies, and the shadows of
Christ to come .· for the Divine wisdom was pleased to im—
bue the infancy of his Church with these, as with certain
first principles of Religion, and to prepare it to receive
Christ, and the perfectiori of the doctrine of the Gospeh
when it should arrive at full age. Ι come over to this opi-
