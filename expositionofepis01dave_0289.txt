Ver. 17. EPISTL'E To THE conossmas 203

By him all things consist] This is a new and excellent
privilege of Christ, that he not only made all things at
first, but that he also sustains and supports thern by his
Divine energy, in such a manner that, if he should with-
draw i‘t, they would again sink into their former non-
entity.

This, therefore, is the doctrine of this passage3 Every
creature, whether earthly or heavenly, visible or invisible,
would sink back again into its former nothingness, if the
Divine preservation were withdrawn. This proposition of
the Apostle is by no means easy to be understood3 there-
fore we will endeavour to support it both by argument and
authorities, as well as clear away what is wont to be ad-
vanced against it.

1. No acting force of the agent remains in the effect,
when the action of the agent has ceased, unless in some
way or other that force be converted into the very nature
of the effect, so as to be inherent in it as its own property :
but if it be a something transcending the nature of the
effect, and a property peculial· to the agent alone, then it
must cease when the action ceases. Since, therefore, self-
existence is the pec-uliar property of God alone, it can re-
main in no created body, even for a moment of time after
this action of Divine conservation has ceased. Theolo-
gians illustrate. this argument by comparing the action of
God on the creature, to that of the sun on the atmosphere3
for the essence of every creature has the same relation to
God, as the light of the atmosphere to the ειιηί)ὲ The sun
derives its light from·its own proper nature, the atinos-

[a Philosopher of Phrygia, in Asia], a man of genius and learning, began
to propagate these explications at Rome. He denied any real distinction
between the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and maintained that the
Father, sole Creator of all things, had united to himself the human na-
ture of Christ, Hence his followers were called Monarchians, because of
their denyinga plurality of persons in the Deity3 and also Patropassians,
because, according to Tertullian's account, they believed that the Father
was so intimately united with the man Christ—his Son, that he suffered
with him the anguish of an afflicted life, and the torments of an ignomini-
ous death !''—Mosheim.
