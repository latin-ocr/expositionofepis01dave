‘⁴ Secondly, in that vocal proceeding, had we been overborne
by the multitude of their voices, or received any grievance or af-
front from thern, touching discipline, we would have relieved our
just cause, either by written protestation or better means. But,
whereas neither the civil magistrate, in whose hearing our excep-
tions were constantly uttered‚ did gainsay us, nor any of the
divines in the Synod once opened their mouths, either in offence
of our government or defenee of their own, what needed we to
redouble our stroke upon those that turned not upon us.

‘ Rixa suum finem, cum silet hostis, hahet.’

“ Peradventure, some hot spirits would not have rested in a
formal recorded prote-station neither, but would have charged those
churches to blot those articles out of their confession, and forth-
with to reform their government; otherwise not have yielded ap·
probation to any article of doctrine, as there comprised; but re-
nounced the Synod, and shaken off from his feet the dust of
Dort,—‘ Ι have nothing to do with your conclusione ; I have no
part nor portion in them: what ends you have, how things are
carried, Ι cannot tell, nor eare.’

‘⁴ We confess, we were and are of another mind; our own
dispositions, and the directions of our blessed peace-making
King, kept us from kindling new fires where we had work enough
to quench the old. We then thought, and so still in our con-
sciences are confident, that we forgot not our duty to our vener-
able and sacred Mother, the Church of England, but took a
course conformable to the rules as well of filial obedienee, as of
Christian moderation.

“ And even then, according to our custom of weekly transmit-
ting into England brief narrations of the proceedings in each
several session, to be imparted to his Majesty‚ we, by the next
messengers, sent our relation hereos, as no whit ashamed of our
deportment herein; which, because it was then framed when we
did not imagine that any quarrel would be picked against us, for
more impartial and impassionate attestations‚ is here inserted, as
much as concerneth the particular.
