Ver. 23. EPlsTLE To THE conossiANs. 529

as men, speaking concernz'ng God, are not wortby qs credit,-
Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom- 6.

3. Since salvation and righteousness is not placed in
the comsnands of men, they grievously err who so multi-
ply these burdens of human traditions as thereby to hinder
Christians in the exercises of true righteousness and god-
liness: For, ic commonly happens, that when α thing is paid
where it is not due, it is neglected where it is due, Tertull. De
poenit. This Christ himself complained of, that the peo-
ple of God were drawn away from the observance of the
Divine commands, whilst they were entirely employed
upon the traditione of the Pharisees‚ Matth. xv. 6. Ger-
son‚ De vita Spirit. part. 3, reprehends this in that heap of
ceremonies and traditions of the Papists3 Unnecessary occu· '
pation ιή human traditions begets ignorance oftlze Divine
precepts.--Thus much concerning the second argument from
the origin of these comrnands.

Verse 23.

Which things have indeed a sltem of wisdom in will-worship
and lzunzz'lity, and neglectz'ng of the body ; not in any

lzononr to tlte saties-{sing (gf llzeflesll.

In these words of the Apostle vve have a censure of
human rites and traditione which are obtruded upon Chris-
tians under the notiori of necessity, righteousness, or the
Divine worship. The passage is well worthy of being
diligently considered. For hence we may perceive that the
Papists can allege nothing for their traditions, which was
not alleged by antient impostors, and refuted by Apostles3
that we do nothing else, when we oppose the same, than
what Christ himself, what his Apostles before us have done,
and what they would have us to do for the sake of retain-
ing Christian liberty.
