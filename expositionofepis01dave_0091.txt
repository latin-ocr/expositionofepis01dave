Ver. 1. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 5

Lastly, Paul affixes the name of his office, that he might
excite and stir up himself, to fulfil the work os an Apostle.
For, in calling himself an Apostle, he owns that the duty
of preaching the Gospel was entrusted to hi1n3 and woe
unto him, if he did not perform it.

and 2 Tim. i. 5. He himself also was pious and faithful, as

- this our Apostle in many places testifies. He calls him his
