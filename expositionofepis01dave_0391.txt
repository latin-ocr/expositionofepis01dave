Venae& EpisTLE To Tur. COLOSSIANS. 305

overclouded, and totally blinded: Therefore this mystery
could never have been comprehended by us, unless it had
been made manifest by God,

From this I shall draw only one conclusion:

It is the extreme of folly to construet a Christian creed
out of philosophical principles3 since the doctrine of sal-
vation revealed by the voluntary act of God, could not
have been discovered by any acuteness of human intellect.
Her,e then, the Scholastic doctors, and the Papists who
tread in their footsteps, have erred most eoreoiously, ob-
trudino many dogmas, derived not from divine relation, but
from the arguments of blind reason, as aiticles of the
Christian saith. Of this nature are free-will, inherent
righteousness, the merits of works, and a great many more,
all to be found in the Ethics of the Philosopher3 none
in the Epistles of Paul. Here, then, that warning of the
Apostle‚ Col. ii. 8, may properly be introduced3 Beware
lest any man deceive you through philosophy· For, as Tertul-
lian, advers. Marc. lib. l, truly asserts, All heresies have
drawn existence from the ln‘ains of Philosoplzers.

Thus much, then, as to the manifestation itself: Now
let us proceed to notice the time when it was made.

Secondly, the Apostle says, Now this mystery is made
manifest. By using this adverb of time, the Apostle takes
occasion to press upon the Corinthians the present oppor-
tunity, which he much wished them to seize3 as though he
would say, That which was concealed from all the past
ages, could neither be known, nor received by them, to
their salvation3 but being by the free grace of God, mani—
fested and revealed to you, through the Apostles, at the pre-
sent time, it both ought, and may be, at. the present time,
acknowledged and received by you.

Observe 1. It is incumbent on all Christians to take
advantage of present time and opportunity, according to
that exhortation‚ Heb. iii. 15, To-clay‚ whilst it is called to-
day, is yse will hear llis voice harden not your lzearts. For if
we reject the Gospel, the condenination which awaits us to
whom it lias been manifested, will be greater than that of
