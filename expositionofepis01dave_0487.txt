excuse this manifest superstition3 They are endnred, says
he, because they cannot be utterly eradicated‚ and because the
saith of the common people is regulated, and preserved by the
saith o‘f' their superiors. But what is that regulated saith of
their superiors concerning these things? Hear ye, leis is
the intention of the chnrch, that such things be done, not as ne-
cessarily efficat-iotis, or as though the chief hope were placed in
such things, preferring them to their obligations to God; hut
that the piel-y of saith. naa-y hc* nonrished and increased by these
things. But we shall refer both these, and monastical ob-
