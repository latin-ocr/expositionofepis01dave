And the Father qfour Lord, διο. These words are not so
to be understood, as though God were one, and the Father
of Christ another3 but are to be explained in this manner,
to God and the Fatlzer qf Christ, i. e. to God, which God is
also the Father of Christ: or so, We give thanks to God and
the Fatlzer of Christ, i. e. to Him who is both the God of
Christ, and at the same time also the Father of Christ.

He is called the Godof Christ in regard of his human
nature. For the human nature of Christ, like other crea-
tures, hath God for Creator and Preserver; whence Christ
hanging upon the crOSS, cried to the Father, My God, my
God, why lzast thoaforsalcen me? Matth. xxvii. 46 ε and in
John xx, 17, said, I ascend to my God and-‘your God,

But he is called tlte Fatlzer of Clu-isc also in respect of
each of his natures. For the Father by an eternal and in-
effable generation hath communicated to his Son his Divine
essence. I say by an eternal generation: because we must
not think in divine things that God the Father is prior to
his Son, as among creatures the father always is. Well
spake Damascenus,»<= 'Em‘ μὲν gur τῆς 'rhu ‘Troia ’γεννήσεως ἀσεβὲς·
λέγειν χρονον μεσιἹεῖσαίε with respect then to tlze generation of
the Son it is impious to say that there was interval qf time.
For the Son is not brought into existence from a state of
non-existence, but always was with the Father‚ and in him
from all eternity‚ and without beginning begotten by him.

'¹ Johannes Damascenus, or John of Damascus, so called from his being
born at that place, where his father, though a Christian, was Counsellor of
State to the Caliph of the Saracens. He was educated by a Monk of Je-
rusalem, from whom 110 imbibed the religious opinions of the times, and
became one of the most distinguished writers of the eighth century. On
the death of his father he succeeded him in the situation he had held, and
occasioned great troubles and vexations to the Emperor of Constantinople,
by becoming an active defender of image worship. Yet, though thus hete-
rodox, he left a treatise, from which the above citation is quoted, on the
orthodox faith, against all heresies, which seems of value. The two kinds
of Theology‚ which the Latins termed scholastic and didactic, were united
in this laborious performance. The book, says Moshiem, was received
among the Greeks wilh the highest applause, and was so extensively ad-
mired, that at length it came to be acknowledged among that people as the
only rule of divine truth 2 It was published with his other works in Greek
and Latin by Lequien, in 2 vols. folio, in 1712.
