152 AN EXPOSITION oF sT. PAUL’S Chap-i·

for porcions, he would have us to understand the wide dis-
tinction between this heavenly and an earthly inheritance.
For an earthly inheritance the more it is divided among se-
veral, the less is possessed by each: but the heavenly
kingdom is possessed entire by innumerable saints3 yet so
that the number of the participants hinders not the most
perfect and full participation to each.

2. But because he calls eternal life α lut, he intimates
under the name of a lot that this kingdom is not to be at-
tained by our own strength or virtues, but is bestowed
upon us by divine Providence3 as we have it in Prov· xvi.
33, lee lot is cast into tlte lap ; Jelzovae autem est ratio ejus, as
Tremellius renders it; but tlte Lord ‘is the disposer (ff it.

3. It is called the lot of the saints, not of all persons
indiscriminately,that the unbelieving and unholy may under-

4. Lastly, this inheritance of the blessed is said to be
laid up in light, that we may understand it to be some-
thing lovely, delightful, and comforting in the highest de-
gree3 for nothing can be more lovely or more pleasant than
light. That region of the saints shines not by the light of
the sun,for the glorjy of God dotlz lighten it, (md the Lamb
is tlte light thereos, Rev. xxi. 23. By this metaphor then,
the kingdom of heaven is contrasted with that place of
torment which is said to be filled with thick darkness, that
the mind may conceive of it, as a place most horrible, hi-
deous, and loathsome. He would therefore inflame us
with a love of this lot of the saints, which is illumined
with such light3 and fill us with horror at that opposite
