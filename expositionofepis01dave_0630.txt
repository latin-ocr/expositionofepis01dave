thus you find that neglecting or chastising of the body,
which is full of superstition, is to be exploded‚ although
that chastising of the body which isjoined with true know-
ledge and due moderatiori, is to be retained. And thus
much of the three pretences whereby impostors are accus-
tomed to gloss over their commands and superstitious doc-
trines. Now let us hear what is the Apostolic censure of
mandates and things of this kind.

Yet they are of 770 valae, since they respect those things
with which lheflesh isfilled] Thus Beza. [Not in any ho-
nour (supply, do they hold the bod-y) to the salisfying or

They who approve this latter interpretation, think that

to this earthly body, not only because it is the necessary
organ of the soul‚ but because it is the temple of the
Holy Spirit, because it is a member of the body of Christ3
nay, if it be esteerned in the place of a beast of burden,
still it is proved that sufficient aliinent is due to it: fora
