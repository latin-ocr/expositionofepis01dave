IN THF, MINISTERS OF ‘run (tostam. lV

ministers‚ who differed from each other, not merely in variety of
gists, but in a certain imparity of dignity and power, (l Cor. xii.
28, 29‚) God laath set z'n his Clam-ch, first Apostles, secondly
prophets, then terrebam, ᾀτ. Are all Apostles? Are all pro-
phem, &cst They who will have all ministers to be of equal
power, appear either not to know what Christ did, or account it
unfit for his Church to imitate the same.

Let us descend, in the third place, to the Apostles themselves;
and we assert, that, before they departed from earth to heaven,
they placed in the great cities a Bishop, in authority superior to,
and in power greater than, the other Presbyters. He was chief
pastor of that city; he possessed a superiority‚ not only over the
laity, but over the Clergy or Presbyters of the same city. Such
was Titus at Crete, Timothy at Ephesus, James at Jerusalem,
Euodias at Antioch, Amianus at Alexandria, Polycarp at Smyrna, ι
not to mention others, who, it is most certain, were exalted to the
episcopal seat, the Apostles being alive, and seeing‚ approving,
nay, even directing, that very thing. lt is also certain that,
throughout the universal Church of Christ, the successors of these
also held a certain eminent authority over their own flock, and
over inferior ministers: and it is equally certain that there was a per-
petual succession of the same. This is attested by the very titles
which the antients continually apply to these Bishops, and to their
successors: They are called the. Great Pastors, Prelates, Heads‚
Princes of the ΟΙιανεΙι.ἦε If the power and dignity of all ministers
were equal, they never would have ‹lignified‚ or rather derided,
Bishops above others with these empty titles. Nay, Christ himself
gave to those chief Pastors of his churches, whom we call Bishops,
the especial appellation of Angels (Rev. ii.) In the Church of Ephe·
sus, of Smyrna, of Pergamos, and the rest, there were many Presby-
ters; but there was in each one Angel, or Bishop, whom Christ ad-
dresses singly. If he had been one of the body of Presbyters, nei-
ther in dignity nor power greater than the rest, there was no reason
why Christ should address him, as it were, by name. Beza not
inaptly expounds these words (Rev. ii.), To THE ANGEL or THE
CHURCH or ΕΡΗΕευε, tlzat is, to the President; which term
very well suits a Bishop, who presides not only over the laity, but
the other Clergy. But what he adds about the office of this Pre-
sideut not being perpetual, is so clearly refuted by ecclesiastica-11
