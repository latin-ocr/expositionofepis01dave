Ver. 17. EPlSTLE To THE cotosslAns. 489

Verse 17.

Which are α shadow of things to come: but the body is of
Christ.

The Apostle concluded in the preceding verse, that Chris-
tians are not to be judged or condemned because they do
not observe the ceremonial law concerning the difference of
meats and appointed festivals. Lest this should seem im-
pious to the Jews, who knew that these ceremonies had'
been sanctioned by God himself, he meets their secret
thoughts, and demonstrates the afore-mentioned conclu·
sion by the most solid reason. His reason is derived from
analogy ε As the shadow hath relation to its body, so have
the ceremonies of the law to Christ and the Gospel: but
where the body is, it is ridiculous to catch at and embrace
its shadow: therefore, since we have Christ and the Gos-
pel, it is foolish to retain ceremonies. But to proceed in
order we shall here consider three things:

l. That the rites of the Mosaic, law concerning meats,
holy days, and other matters were shadows of future things ς
cltey are shadows qf things to come.

2. That the things shadowed out are exhibited and
clearly manifested to us in Christ and the Gospe13 bnt tlte
body is os Christ.

3. That since it is so, it is meet that these shadows
should be abolished3 which the Apostle intended to shew
by this contrast. · ·

l. Which are α shadow of things to coma] That is,
Which ceremonies obscurely delineate the offices and be-
nefits of Christ, and the doctrine of the Gospe13 for these
are those things to come of which the Apostle speaks.
Whence Augustine (contra Faustum) calls the Mosaic ce-
remonies prenunciative observations. And Paul says that
they are, not that they were, shadows of things to come,
