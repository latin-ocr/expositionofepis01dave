LlFE OF BlslloP DAVENANT. XlV

to his sermons, is worthy of citation‚ as well for its good sense⁷
as for the testimony it bears to our Author. “ In matters of doc-
trine, he (Hacket) embraced no private and singular opinions, as
many great men deligbt to do, z'n vetere via novam semitam quee-
rentes, says the father, (Jerome); but was in all points a perfect
Protestant, according to the Articles of the Church of England;
always accounting it a spice of pride and vanity to affect singula-
rity in any opinions or expositions of Scriptum, without great
cause; and withal very dangerous to affect precipices, as goats
use, when they may walk in plain paths. In the Quinquarticular
Controversy, he was ever very moderate; but, being bred under
Bishop Davenant and Dr. Ward, in Cambridge, was addicted to
their sentiments. Bishop Usher would say, Davenant understood
those controversies better than ever any man did since St, Austin.
But He used to say, he was sure he had three excellent men of his
mind in this controversy, l. Padre Pauloj* whose letter is extant to
Heinsius, anno 1604: 2. Thomas Aquinas: 3. St. Austinz-brlt,
besides and above them all, he believed in his conscience, St.
Paul was of the same mind likewise : yet would profess withal, he
disliked no Arminian, but such a one as reviled and defamed every
one that was not so : and would often commend Arminius himself
for his excellent wit and parts, but only tax his want of reading
and knowledge in antiquity: and ever held it was the foolishest
thing in the world to say the Arminians were Papists, when so
many Dominicans aud Jansenists were Anti-Arminians: and so
again to say the Anti-Arminians were Puritans or Presbyterians,
when Ward, and Davenant‚ and Pfldeaux, and Brownrig, were
Anti-Arminians, and also stout champions for Episcopaey ;† and
Arminius himself was ever a Presbyterianz—and, therefore, he
much commended the moderation of our Chureh, which made not
any of these nice and doubtful opinions the resolved doctrine of

¹* The famous Historian of the Council of Trent.

† To which might be added Hooker, Whitgift, Bancroft, Hau, Saunder-
son, Beveridge‚ and innumerable others. In fact, the ablest defences of
our Church have proceeded from the pens of writers of these views. So
true is the remark os Bishop Horsley : ‘⁶ If we would look for warrn advo-
cates of Church authority in general, and for able writers in ‹lefence of our
own form of Church governrnent in particular, such we shall find among
those Divines of our Church who were called in their day the Doctrinal
Calvinists.'’ Charge at Rochester, 1800. It may be permitted us again
to refer the Reader to Davenant's sentiments on this subject in the Ques-
tion given at the end of this life.
