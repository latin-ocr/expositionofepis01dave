Ver. 2. El’rs'rLE To THE coLOSSIANs. 47

Another observation must be added which also pertains
to the Major3 viz. that every conclusion is of saith which
is drawn from one proposition contained in Scriptum, and
another¹ following by fair consequence3 whether it be
known by sense, or by reason, or in any other mode. This
Gerson teaches, De vita spirit3 and Medina.

Now I come to the Minor; and Ι deny that it may not
be maintained by evident inference from the word that this
or that believer bath his sins remitted. For Scripture
speaks to individuals; Rom. x. 9, If thou skalt coiy‘ess wiclz
thy moulh the Lord Jesns, ancl skalt believe in thiae beart that
God hatlz raised himfrom the dead, thou skalt be saved.

But Bellarmin urges that the Minor proposition is as yet
wanting, viz. I confess, and Ι believe: therefore the oon-
clusion, I shall be saved, cannot be derived from faith. ’

I answer, as above, that this Minor does not respect any
general doctrine of faitb, but the particular act of the be-
liever: it must not therefore be sought in our Bibles, but
in our hearts. But now if by any spiritual perception, or
certain experience, or, lastly, by the testimony of the Holy
Spirit, or by all these, the Minor proposition be establish-
ed, the conclusion will be of faith, because the Major pro-
position was of saith. And we have before proved from
the Fathers, froin the Schoolmen, and from the Scriptures,
that believers have a clear knowledge of their faith and
reconciliation ε the same things therefore we shall not
again repeat.

Still our adversary urges 3 We see many to be really de-
ceived‚ thinking they have faith and grace when they have
not. For many heretics boast the assurance of faith3 many
also think,though not renewed, that they have obtained faith,
and the remissiori of their sins from God: therefore they
have not this certainty of which they make such a parade.

Ianswer; all this is nothing to the point. For we do
not maintain that every man who dreams that he has saith,
grace, and the remissiori of sins, is really possessed of

years; and of the twelve folio volumes which resulted from all his labour
and study, how small a portion would probably repay the trouble of pe-
rusal!
