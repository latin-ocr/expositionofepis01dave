God testffies, that they who truly believe and are converted
obtain remission of sins: I am sure that Iam a true be-
liever and penitent3 thereforeI have obtained remission of
my sins. The Minor, says Bellarmin, is not only false,
but also impossible without a special revelation.

Answer. Before Ι come to the Minor, Ι will premise a
few words in explanation of the Major. What Bellarmin
says, That nothing can be sure with the certainty of saith,
unless it be propounded or deduced from Scripture, must
be understood concerning the doctrine of saith which we
believe, not concerning the habit or act of saith by which
we believe. For example: That God is three in one is a.
doctrine of faith; of this therefore we are sure because it
is thus written in our Bible; but my believing in the Tri-
nity in Unity, is an act of my saith, the certainty of which
is not written in the Scriptures, but on the tablets of my
heart. Certainty of the former respects the whole Church;
therefore it is revealed in Scripture, which lies open to the
whole Church: but the certainty of the latter, that is to
say, of the habit or act of faith dwelling in the heart of
this or that man, respects him alone, and is therefore dis-
covered to him alone by a reflex aot of the mind itself‚ and
still more clearly by the internal operation of the Holy
spirit, who, together with saith and grace, gives a con-
sciousness of that faith and grace being· received, as we
have before proved. Here we may adduce Scotus, who, 3
dist. 23, says, Like as I believe tlzat God is three in person
and one in essence ; so also I believe, that I havefaitlz itffusecL

⁴¹ Davenant here cites from Duns Scotus, a famous Scholastic Divine
who flourished in the fourteenth centnry3 a Briton by birth, educated first
in the Convent of Franciscan Friars at Newcastle, and then sent to Ox-
ford, where he made rapid progress and was soon distinguished. It is said
that not less than 30‚000 students came to Oxford to hear his Lectures:
This led to his transfer, by his 0rder, to Paris, where he was appointed
Regent of the Divinity Schools. He was considered one of the first wrang-
lers of his time, and was an indefatigable writer. Such was his acuteness
and ability as to obtain for him the epithet of Doctor Subtilis; but differ-ing
with his Master Aquinas about the efficacy of divine grace, he gave rise to
a controversy which engaged the learned in eager and trifling disputes for
