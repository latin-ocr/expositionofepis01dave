X LlFE OF Blsnop DAVENANT.

offered him, which his father would not permit him to accept, on
account of his plentiful fortune3 which course our Bishop aster-
wards adopted, when President of the College: for, having given
his vote against one of his own rich relations, (afterwards Sir
John Gore‚) he said, ‘⁶ Cousins, I will satisfy your father that
you have- worth, but not want enough, to be of our Society.”
However, in 1597, he was elected Fellow against his will: the
President replying to his objections with the remark, that ‘⁶ pre-
ferment was not always a relieffor want, but sometimes an encou-
ragementforworth.” In 1601, he took his degree of B.D., and
proceeded, in 1609, to D.D., and was the same year elected,
against seven competitors, Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity ;
which he appears to have owed in a great measure to the high
testimony of Dr.Whittaker. He was also presented by Archbishop
Abbot‚ to the Rectory of Cottenham‚ Cambridgeshire.

In 1613—14‚ a Royal party visiting Cambridge, on occasion of
the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth with the Prince Palatine
Frederic, and an entertainment being given to them, Davenant
was selected as Moderat0r‚ in the Theological Disputation, which,
according to the custom of the age, then occurred. In the fol-

took place, between some chief divines of England and of the
Palatinate, among whom the great Heidelburgh Professor, Abra-
ham Scultetus, distinguished himself. The Margaret Professor
was then also appointed Moderator. The questions discussed, as
we learn from Nicholl's Progresses of James Ι., were these
three ε Nulla est temporalis Papae potestas supra reyes, in ordine

It is amusing to hear the con amore animation with which the
excellent, but pedantic Bishop Hacket, in his Life of Archbishop
Williarns, p. 26, records these academical feats. Speaking of
one super-eminent disputant, Dr.Collins, he thus p1·Oceeds:—“ He
was a firm bank of earth, able to receive the shot of the greatest
artillery. His works in print, against Euclaemon and Fitzherbert,
sons of Anak among the Jesuits‚ do noise him far and wide. But
they that heard him speak would most admire him. No flood can
be compared to the spring-tide of his langnage and eloquence, but
the milky river of Nilus, with his seven mouths all at once disem-
boguing into the sea. O how voluble ! how quick ! how facetious
he was! What aVertumnus when he pleased to argue 011 the
