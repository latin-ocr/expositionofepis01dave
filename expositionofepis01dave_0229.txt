this doctrine? Doubtless that by the understanding of it
all seductive subtleties may be dissipated.

By laying down the same foundation concerning the
sufficiency of Christ the Redeemer and Mediator, we shall
be able to expose and crush the errors of the Papists, re-
specting the invocation of saints, the necessity of human
satisfactions‚ the granting of indulgences, and many others
with which they have contaminated the Christian Religion.
Most truly said Calvin, Popery stands not except with igno-

'¹‘ Our Expositor has here cited an authority, a reference to whom is, in
the minds of some well-meaning and otherwise sensible and intelligent per-
sons, more odious than an exhibition of sin itself. But none, surely, will
object to, or take offence, at the sentiment adduced, so truly in point, εκ,-
cept those who favour the dominance of that noxious and blighting system
justly animadverted upon. The Translat0r‚ however, cannot refrain from
taking occasion to observe, that whilst we are to yield deference to names, or
parties, only so far as they speak the language and follow the steps of
Christ, we should still not stand aloof from the admission os truth, on ac-

the knowledge and the consideration, of every fearful and prejudiced person7.
in reference to the character under notice. ‘⁶ The Commentaries and other
expository writings of this great man” [Calvin]‚ says he, “ have always

Commentaries‚'’ says the learned Matthew Poole, in the preface to the
‘ Synopsis Criticorum Sacrorum‚’ “ abound in solid discussions of theologi-

have borrowed most of their materials from Calvin ς and his interpretations
