writes that others, on account of their continued watch-

6. cap. 49, in Psalrn xci. writes, that certain Monks‚ by
various exercises of the body, and abstinences, were worn
down beyond their strength, beyond nature, beyond cus-
tom. Jerome, in his epitaph on Paula, relates, that when
she had recovered from a burning fever, she was altogether
unwilling to use the weakest and smallest quantity of wine,
although her Physician, and Jeroine himself, earnestly ad-
vised her to it, and shewed her the imminent danger of a
dropsy from continually drinking water. But the most
celebrated of all for this mortifying of the body were,
the Flagellantes, whose order arose in the year 1260, at Pe-
rusia, in Tuscany, when the whole world suffered from α dread-
ful famine. These men, wandering about, beat themselves pub-
licly almost to death, and exere-ised these bloorly ritesfor thirty-
three clay& then they thought that they had expiated their
sins and were reconcilecl to God, and at length they returned
to their homes. Hospin. pag. 2713*ss lt would be easy to

”⁵ Our Expositor here referS, Ι presume, to the work De Monachatu, of
a distinguished Swiss divine, Rodolph Hospinian, who flourished towards
the latter part of the sixteenth century, being born at Altdorf, in the Can-
ton of Zurich, in 1547. Having received a liberal education at Zurich,
Marpurg, and Heidelburg, he entered the Church in 1568, and three years
afterwards obtained the freedom of the city of Zurich, and the superin-
tendance of the Abbey Sehool there. He was considered the only Scholar
capable of refuting the Annals of Baronius, then Confessor to Clement
VIII. and afterwards Cardinal, and very near succeeding to the Popedom
in 1605, a celebrated, but partial historian of the Church, whose work,
though of vast learning, is entirely perverted to the interests of Rome.
Hospinian gained universal applause by the portions of his work against
Baronius, printed occasionally under the title of ‘⁶ the History of the
errors of Popery.'' Besides this elaborate work, he wrote a history of the
Jesuits, and several other pieces.
