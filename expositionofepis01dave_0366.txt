280 AN EXPOSITION 01·- sT. PAUL'S Chap.i.

ment of their offences : In vain, therefore, do the Papists
attempt to establish a treasure upon these grounds. And
this we prove,

l. Because, by the general consent of Theologians, no
man’s merits, save those of Christ alone, extend beyond
the man himself. To this the Papists readily answer, that
the works of the saints, as to their merits, do not extend
beyond the individual himself, nor are transferable to other
men3 but thatin respect of their satisfactory virtue, they
may be both imputed and imparted to others. But we shall
easily get rid of this distinction, For whatever has been
already most highly rewarded in the saints themselves, can-
not still remain to be rewarded, or in any way to be im-
puted to others for their remission; but both the sufferings
and all the good works of the saints, as well meritorious
as satisfactory, are most abundantly rewarded by that sin-
gle gift of bliss eternal. For these works are, (as they
maintain) meritorious as far as they originate in love3 and
satisfactory as far as they have penalty attached to them3
But whether we consider love, or penalty, or any thing
else as the condition of works, that single prize suffices
for a most ample remunerati0n3 nay, further, tlte szgffet‘ings
(gf this present time are nol worthzs to be compared with ille
glory which shall be revealed. Rom. viii. 18.

2. Secondly, No man can make satisfaction for another
in respect of an inj ury done to a third person, unless by per-
mission of the person to whom the injury is done. Where-
fore Aquinas, in commenting upon those words in Rom.

But God never ordained, according to his purpose, that
any of the saints should make satisfaction for us; there-
fore no satisfaction of theirs delivers us from punishment.
