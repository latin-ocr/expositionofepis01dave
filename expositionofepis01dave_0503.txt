(or a human person), because that soul and body which he
assumed, were not previously united together personally‚
but they derive their personality from the Word dwelling
bodily‘in that human nature.

And this may suffice as to the mode of this hypostatical
union3 for the human mind is not ableto fathom the whole
depth of this mystery. If any doubt remam, Applyfaz'llz,
as Justin Martyr speaks, which will render the solution easy.
Piously and modestly does Chrysostom remark on this
matter: Ι know tlzat the W'ord was madeflesh, but how lze was
made so I lcnow not. Do you wonder because I lcnow ic not?
Every creature is ignorant of it. We are not, however, so
entirely ignorant of the mode, but that we can, out of the
Scriptum, stop the mouths of heretics who deny it. Let·
us, therefore, briefly solve the objections which they are
wont to allege against this personal union. And those ob-
jections are advanced either as to the Divine, or as to the
human nature.

1. As to the Divine nature they object: The Son of
God or the person of the Lo‘yoq, was a perfect substance
from all eternity: but nothing can be added to a perfect
substance ; therefore the human nature was not taken into
personal union with the Word.

We answer, Nothing can be added to the constitution of
the essence of a perfect substance3 as to communion with
its complete essence somewhat may be added. For although
the hypostasis of the Word was perfect by reason of his
nature, yet for the perfection ‹gfllze end, which is to redeem
the Church, there could, nay there must be something add-
ed to this perfect substance, namely, the human nature, in
which the Son of God by his blood might purchase the
Church to himself. But here we must beware not to think
that the human nature is so added to the Divine hypostasis,
as to be an equal part os it, by a mutual union constitut-
ing this hypostasis, but that it is ενυποςταιτον, i. e. subsistz'ng
in tlte person, not as an equal part, but as an instrument per-
taz'nz'ng to tlze unity of the hypostasis, as Damascenus ex-
presses it3 or as a thing subsisting in its principal. And
from this it appears how we should receive what is contend-
