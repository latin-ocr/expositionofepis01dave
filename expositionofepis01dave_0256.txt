170 AN ExPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL’s Clzczp. i.

From what has been thus said concerning the method of
our redemption, various passages of Scripture apparently
opposed to each other, are reconciled: Some of which as-
sert that we are justified and saved lively, as Rom. iii. 243
others teaoh that we are redeemed with a price, as l Cor. vi.
ΩΟ. Some declare that by the might and power of Christ,
we were delivered from the power of the devil, and that he
was spoz'led, triumphes] over, and desstoyed, as Col. ii. 15,
Heb. ii. 14. Now all these passages are equally true. For
we are redeenied and savedsreely, as it respects ourselves3
since we ourselves contributed nothing to our redemption.
We are redeemed with a price, as it respects God3 for
Christ offered his own blood to him for our redemption.
We are delivered by power and might, as respects the de-
vil; whom, being previously conquered by Christ, and
delivered over to him by right, He spoiled by force of
arms.

From this redemption obtained by the death and blood
of Christ alone, we deduce these inferences;

1. We are not our own masters, but the servants of the
Redeemer: we ought not therefore to serve our own lusts,
but to yield obedience to his commands.

2. Neither our own satisfactions, nor merits, nor the
sufferings of martyrs, could redeem us from the penalties

for the Catholic Faith rendered him obnoxious to the Eutychians, by whom
he was deposed in the Synod which they held at Ephesus; but he was re-
stored to his diocese by the Council ofChalcedon in 421. Nothing is known
of his future history, except that he was alive till after A.D. 460, and was
renowned for the sanctity and simplicity of his manners, and as an eloquent,
copious, and learned writer, remarkable for his acquaintance with all the
branches of sacred erudition. He wrote, besides his Ecclesiastical History
from the time of Constantine to that of Theodosius the younger, and his
Discourses on Providence above adverted to, Commentaries on the Scrip-
tures3 Epistles; Lives of famous Anchorites3 Dialogues3 and Books on
Heresy. In his ingenious and learned treatise, De curandis Graecorum af.
sectionibus, ‘· he opposed,” says Mosheim, ‘⁶ with fortitude and vigour,
those that worshipped images;'’ and in his first and second dialogues occur
some remarkable passages, bearing decisive evidence that the doctrine of
transubstantiation was not then known to the Church. The Jesuit Sirmond
gave at Paris, in the year 1642, a noble edition of the works of this pre-
late, in four vols. folio. Garnier published an edition in 1648, to which he
added a fifth volume.
