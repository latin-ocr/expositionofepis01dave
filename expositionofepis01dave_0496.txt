doctrine to men, no one may dare to think of its abroga-
tlon.

3. The Gospel is to be received by all the faithful, not
only as perpetual doctrine, but as certain, as perfect, as
saving3 but as soon as it is known that in him who
brought the Gospel into the world the Godhead dwelt in
that mode in which it is here asserted, it is immediately
understood that in the doctrine of such a person, certainty,
perfection, and salvation are found. For they who receive
the rule of saith directly from truth itself, can in no wise
be deceived. Well said Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom¹ 6,
Men, speaking as men about God and divine things, are not
worchy of credit ; hut the voice <ff the Lord is more wortliy of
credit than any demonstration. Neither can the doctrine
fall under the suspicion of imperfection, Which He, all
whose works are perfect, would not divulge by his Minis-
ters, but by himself. Lastly‚ that must necessarily be
saving, which He taught who is the only way to salvation.

It &vas fit that the doctrine of salvation (as you see)
should be prornulgated not by a mere man, but by God
dwclling in human nature. We will now also shew that the
very work of our salvation required this indwelling of God

in our nature.
l. Because human nature being severed from God, and

alienated from the life and communion of God through sin,
is most suitably restored to the communion of God, and
most firmly preserved in the same, by this mode. The Fa-
thers commonly assign this reason. Iraeneus, lib. 4. cap.
59, says, How can the Ebionites be saved, if lze henot God
who wrouglzt out their salvation upon eartlz? and how shall
man pass over meto God, {f God pass not over meto man&

⁸ Ebionites‚ the followers of Ebion, an Heresiarch of the first Century,
who, though he rejected, with Cerinthus, that portion of the Gospel of St.
Matthew containing an account of the miraculous conception, yet invented
a modification of Cerinthus's error, that Christ was born of human parents
in the ordinary way ς but still considerlng him no more than a mere man.
Against this heresy Iraeneus particularly wrote: and in what a dangerous
case he viewed those who imbibed the heresy, under any form, may be
judged froin the quotation adducet] above. Dr. Priestley attempted to set
aside the sorec of Iraeneus‘s testimony against it ; with what grounds for his
