Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE coLoSslANs. 353

this, the godly have this full assurance of Gospel truth.
Clemens, Strom 7, rightly says, Trullc is to be found, by
those who wz'sh it, from a diligent sear-elz of the Scripture.
And Lactantius, Institut. lib. 7. cap. 2, asserts what is very
much to our purpose: We do not attain trutlz by thinking
aud disputing, but by hearing and learning from Him who
alone can both lfnow aud teaclm i. e. (as I interpret it) from
the Holy spirit, speaking ontwardly in the Scriptures, and
inwardly in the heart of each believer. Thus far offall
assur-auce.

Lasssy, that we should weigh what the Apostle adds,
that they would have not only afall assarance, but afall
assarance of understandiug, i. e. the unclerscanding fully as-
sured. The mind, therefore, is not only inclined firmly to
adhere to what is believed by the power of the will when
softened by grace3 but the intellect, at the same time, is
so brightened by supernatural light, that it can clearly
contemplate the certain and indubitable truth of these
things. Thus Parisiensis, in his Tractat. de fide. cap. l.
writes. No power can effect any thing either contrary to or
above itseff. Consequently the human intellect cannot be—
lieve of itself; and it is therefore necessary that it should
be enlightened by a stronger light and greater illumination.
It is by this light, then, that the intellect conceives a pro-
position which is behind, and at the same time sees the
formal reason why it is believed. Now this reason is nei-
ther a scientific‚ nor demonstrative medium, but Divine au-
thority. For infused saith shews the intellect that the
doctrine it believes is derived from God. Gerson excel-
lently sets forth this in this treatise on errors in regal-d to
saith. Au infused faitlz is requisile, says he, jor every one’s
assent to Catlzolie irath, which poinls out and shews ille reason
(f belief} viz. that God lzati'z delivered this trutlz. This is,
therefore, to have 3 full assurance of the understandfflg,
both to perceive the truth itself and its Author. It appears
from Scripture that this enlightened understanding is al-
waysjoined with saith. Thus Ephes. i. 17, The Father of
glory may give meto you tlze Splrit of wisdom and revelation
ite tlze knowledge of him, the eyes cffqyom· understandiug being
