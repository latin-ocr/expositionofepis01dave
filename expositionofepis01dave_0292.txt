206 AN EXPOSITION or s'r. PAUL’S Chap. i.

Augustine, sup. Genes. ad lit. lib. 4. cap. 13, says, The
power and energy of an Almiglzty and All-sustaining God, is
the cause of subsistence to every creature: and if that energy
which created them should at any time ceasefrom riding them,
their species would all at once cease, and all naturefall to no-
thing. If, therefore, we credit Augustine, no creature
whatever could exist without this Divine upholding‚ or ma-
nntention, to use the scholastic term.

Gregory, Moral. 16. cap. 18, on those words of Job,
xxiii. 13, He alone is, observes, But why does he sais, He
alone is? All these things (says he) are, andyet fundamen-
tally they are not, because in themselves they have no snbsistence,·
and unless they were uphei-'d by the hand of their Governor, they
would by no means exist. For all things subsist by him who
created them. Inasmuch as all things were made of nothing,

,and their being would again fall into nothing, unless it were
retained by the hand which made them all.

Gerson, De vit. spirit. lect. l. says, As a vessel contains
water and gives it its shape, so that it is preventedfromflow-
ing away rather by the help (ff the vessel than by its own na-
ture; so God in his own nature prevents the defectible principle
(ff the creature from riding, and preserves it Ins his agerici] from
falling back again into nothing.

Let us now meet some objections to the contrary.

l. A created agent communicates to the work made,
the power of holding together when his operation has
ceased, as we continually see in an architect and his build-
ing: Therefore God, whose operations are far more perfect
than those of any artificer‚ must impart this property to
his works.

We answer, There is no parity of reasoning. For a crea-
ted agent is the cause of that work being constructed only,
and not of its continuance in existence. A house, for in-
stance. depends upon the architect only as long as it is in
building; but when it is actually built, it depends for its
existence, as I have before shewn, upon the nature of the
materials. But with God the case is very different3 be-
cause (as we have proved) he is the cause of the original
existence as well as of the formation of all things. It in-
