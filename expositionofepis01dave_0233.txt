the grace of God alone makes us meet for the participation
of divine things, in effectually calling us, justffiving, and
sanctifying us by a certain internal operation of his
spirit.

But besides this operation of God, which renders us
meet by changing and regenerating ns, the merciful ac-
ceptance of God is also required, to cover cur infirmities
and reckon our feeble endeavours in the room of perfect
obedience. For as there is nothing good in us, unless we
have been renewed by the divine operation3 so the good
things of the renewed would be even as nothing worth for
the enjoyment of the heavenly heritage, unless they were
accepted by the most indulgent Father for the sake of the
transcendent worthiness of Christ. Therefore, that there
may be in us the least spark of good, the power of God in
working it is required3 and that that good, whatever it be,
may make us meet to be reckoned among the children and
heirs of the kingdom, his fatherly clemency is requisite in
accepting it.

Nor need we look far for a reason why we think this ac-
ceptance necessary, since it is certain, that in the regene—
rate themselves, after the operation of the regenerating
spirit, there is not perfect newness: but as in wine di-
luted, the water as well as the wine is mingled in every
part3 so in the whole renewed man, the qualities of rege-
rati0n and the remains of* corruption, are found blended
together. No one in this lise is tlzorouglzly perfecus& the
