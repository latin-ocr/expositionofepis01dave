his being intended for the Gentiles. The calling of the
Gentiles, therefore, was a mystery altogether hidden from
the greatest part of the Jews. Then, as to those very pro-
phets and more enlightened Jew5, to them also this grace
of the Gospel was a hidden mystery, speaking compara-
tively. For those prophetical revelations were but like a
candle shining in a dark place, in comparison of the decla-
rations of the Evangelists, which are like the shining of
the mid-day sun. They looked to this future calling of the
Gentiles, but only, as through the twilight, very indis-
tinctly3 we look directly upon it in the clear and open
daylight. To this it must be added, that they had only a
general notion of the Gentiles receiving some sort of bles-
sing in the promised seed, at some future time; but they
had no notiori whatever of their being admitted into the
covenant of the sons of God in this manner, thatiS, with*
out circumcision‚ and without any kind of obedience to
the Mosaic ritual. And this we are authorised to conclude
from the circumstance of the Apostles themselves not im-
mediately comprehending this great mystery, even after
they had received their commission to preach the Gospel
to every creature. For Peter would not have ventured to
go in to the uncircumcised, unless God had previously
communicated this mystery to him, and given him the
knowledge of it by a supernatura] revelation. For thus he
expresses himself, Acts x. 28, Ye know how it is zmlawful
for α man that is α Jew to go in lo one (ff another walion ‚· but
God Izatlz shewed me that I should not call any man common or
unclecm.

In the last place, not even the angels clearly understood
this mystery of Gospel grace. For to the priucipalities and
powers in heavenly places, hath been made known by the Church
the mam'fold wisdom of G0d; according to the etet-nal purpose
which he purposed in Christ Jeszcs our Lord; Ephes. iii. lO, 11.
This body of the Church, therefore, composed of Jews and
Gentiles, of circumeised and uncircumcised, inasmuoh as
it was a mystery concealed from all eternity in the secret
will of God, was to the very angels a new and wonderful
thing.
