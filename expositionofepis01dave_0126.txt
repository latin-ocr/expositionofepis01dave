believer as a pledge of divine love3 and he, finally, pro-
nounces in the hearts of the godly, that they are in favour
with God : which testimony they both may and ought to be-
lieve. Therefore they do believe in particular that they are
in the grace of God, and that their sins are remitted them.
The authorities from which all this is proved are well
known ι Rom. viii. 16, lee Spiric bearem witness witta
our spirits that we are the children of G0d; Gal. iv. 6,
Because με ure sons, God bath sentforth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Famem and Ephes. i. 13,
14, Ye were sealed with tlmc Holy spirit, aster that με be-
lieved, which is the earnest ofyour inheritance. Nor is this
testimony fallacious or conjectural, but certain and infal-
lible in all in whom it is found. For the word is the minis-

spirits that we are the children <ff God. But he persuades
by calling and justifying us freely through saith.

Bellarmin replies, that the Holy spirit witnesses to our
spirits only by some experience of an internal suavity and
peace which produces nothing better than a conjectural
certainty. De justif. lib. iii. cap. 9.

But Bernard rejects this jesuitical comment: for he says
this testimony is received by the act of saith ; and that the
Holy Spirit persuades our spirit that we are the children of
God, by saith, not by fallible conjectures. So Chrysos-
*tom in viii. ad Rom. When tlze spirit testffies can any doubt
