Ver. 10. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 425

mess. More briefly and explicitly says Bernard, Serm. ad
milit. temp. ll, Death is put tofliglzt by the death of Clzrisc ‚-
and the righfeozcsness <ff Christ is imputed to us ; and Epist.
190, T he righteousness of another is assigned co man, because
he had none of his own. We have saving righteousness,
therefore, in Christ.

3. In Christ we have sanctification, or indwelling righ-
teousness. For what else is sanctification than a cleansing
from sins and iniquities, whereby we were separated far
from God; and a reception of gifts and greces, whereby
we are brought nigh to him to serve him? Truly it is now
manifest, that we are daily both cleansed from the pollu-

lusts of the flesh. For as the needle, being touched by
the magnet, turns itself to the arctio pole3 so the human
beart being touched and quickened by this Spirit of Christ,
turns itself to God and the commands of God, and rests
in them.

Ye now perceive how much the Apostle comprehends in
saying that we are complete in Christ: for by this one word
he shews that we have in Christ whatever is required for
saving knowledge, justification, and sanctification: And
by the same means he crushes all the errors of false Apos-
tles: For if we have complete wisdom in Christ, there is
no need of philosophieal additions3 if complete righteous-
ness, there is no need of legal ceremonies3 if sanctifica-
tion‚ there is as little need of angels for purifiers or en-
lighteners of our souls. Ye observe in what things this
