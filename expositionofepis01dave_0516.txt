long to the body of the Church, then he is also the Saviour
of the angels3 for he is the Saviour ο] the body, Ephes. v.
23: But the angels need not the benefit of a Saviour or
Mediator3 therefore it does not seem that Christ is the
head of angels, as to this procuring of salvation and eter-
nal happiness.

I answer; the angels had no need of Christ as aSaviour
to deliver them from sins committed, for they stood sted-
fast in obedience to God 3 neither did they need the favour
of a Mediator to snatch them from a state of wrath, for
they never had God for their enemy: but they needed
Christ the Saviour, they needed the favour of Christ the
Mediator, that they might retain fixed their condition in
righteousness, that they might have sure and inviolable
peace with God, that they might be accounted worthy of
the eternal and glorious fruition of God3 which beatifio

i. lO, ανακεφαλαιωσασθικι, to have guthered all things together;
and in Colossians i. 20, αποκαταλλάξαι, to have reconciled all
things to God the Falher, whefflzer they be things in earth, or
lhings in heaven. The most learned interpreters expound
each os these texts to relate to this benefit of Christ the
head which is derived to the angels: and although that
word to reconcile, in its proper and primary signification,
cannot apply to the angels, yet in its broader and analogi-
cal application, they have shewn that it may be extended
even to them. In which they follow Bernard, who, in Serm.
