formed to the life of grace by God. For as every natural
motion and operation presupposes a natural power3 so
every spiritual motion (such as is conversion to God) pre-
supposes a spiritual power. That opinion of Bellarmin,
therefore, De grat. et lib. arbitr. i. 12, and iv. ll, is not to
be borne, who would have the efficacious grace of God to
be nothing else than the implanting of such a perception,
whereby the human will is rendered apt to be persuaded to
obedience. The prophet Ezekiel, xi. 19, speaks otherwise,
I will give them α new hear-t ; I will take away the hem-t (gf
stone. And Augustine, De spirit. et lit. cap. 30, The heal-
ing of tlte soal is by grace: tlze freedom of the will by the
healtlzz‘ness of the soul. And Aquinas himself, quaest. disp.
de virtut. art. 10, says, For performi‘ng actions suited to the
attainmentqf eternal li e, grace is first divinelq imparted, by
which the soul hatlz as it were something qf spirituality.

3. Since the cause of death both spiritual and eternal
is the transgression of the Divine law (for he says that the
Colossians were dead in their sins) the madness of almost
all men is discovered, who have. delight in that which is a
deadly poison to the soul‚ He who should give poison to
another, is deservedly adjudged guilty of 1nurder3 what
shall we say of him who causes the death of his own soul
by this poison of sin? I would say with Lactantius, In-
stitut. 3. 18, If a marderer is base, because he is the destroyer
(ff man ,· lze lies under the same wic-Icedness who kills himself,
because he kills α man. But I will affirm that he has more
truly slain a man who has destroyed his own soul in sin-
ning with delight, than if he had only taken away bodily
life from himself.

4. Since the uncc'rcumcisz'on of thestosh, i. e. original cor-
ruption, has pervaded and extinguished the spiritual life of
the soul‚ and all its spiritual fact-hies, we infer that Bellar-
min (lib. 5. cap. 6, de grat. et lib. arb.) and the rest of the
Jesuits, who assert that human nature is not absolutely
less healthy than it would be if created in natural holiness,
too much extenuate this evil. They draw this notion from
Durandus, who, lib. 3. dist. 3, quaest. l, thinks nothing
more was done to human nature by the first sin, except that
