consciences of men with ceremonies, as things necessary
to salvation, and to condemn them for the omission there-
of: thus did the false apostles heretofore3 thus do false
Catholics of the present day, who make the chief worship
of God consist in the observance of their traditions, and
the omission of the same to be the damnable guilt of eter-
nal death. A grave author, Gen-son, Chancellor of Paris,
continually complains of this tyranny of the Popish Pre-
lates, and torturing of consciences. Part. 3, De vita spi-
rit. anim. lect. 4, he says, leeys abuse their power, wlao wislz
whatever they ordain lo hare force by cm obligation lo eternal'
punishment. And a little after3 No law z's to be enucled as
necessary to eternal sammon, wln'clz is not in some degree after
the Divine law.

2. It is the duty of Christians‚ when ceremonial rites
are imposed upon them under the plea of necessity, of
righteousness, or of merit, to reject the same, and to des-
pise those masters of ceremonies: For so the Apostle di-
mets, both in this place and in Gal. v. l, Standfast, there-
fore, in the liberty wlterewitlt Clu-ist bath made us free, and be not
again entangled with the ⁸y ke of bondage. But those are en-
tangled with the yoke of bondage upon whom any ceremo-
nies whatever are imposed as necessary, and meritorious,
and saving. As, therefore, Christian modesty enjoins us
to obey prelates, when they prescribe decorous rites for the
sake of order; so Christian liberty enjoins us to withstand
the same when they obtrude their traditions under the plea
of worship, or of necessity for salvation. For here that
saying of Cypriam, ,De haeret. baptizandis, ought to have
weight, lt is dangeroussor any one to surrender his right in
Dz'vine things.

3. Distinction of meats or of days is not now to be re-
tained by Christians upon the opinion of necessity, of ho-
lmess, of righteouness, or merit. The kingdom qs God is
not meac (md drink, ἕω. Rom. xiv. 17. Wlmtsoever is so.'d in
