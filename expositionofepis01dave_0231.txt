through the spirit of saith, that we are in the number of
those whom God hath made meet for the participation of
eternal life. For it is absurd and preposterous to give
thanks for a benefit received, when you are not yet sure
whether it has been received or not. He therefore who, by
his own example, wishes the Colossians and other Chris-
tians to give thanks to God for having obtained the benefit
of salvation‚ wishes all to labour, that, by a true and live-

The Apostle points out the primary cause of human salva-

Spirit from both. We say that God the Father, or the
whole Trinity‚ is the primary cause of our salvation from
a twofold consideration3

us to eternal lg'fe; as it is said Ephes. i. 4 and 5. For this,
therefore, eternal thanks are to be given to God3 for, with-
out this, assuredly we should be altogether excluded from
heaven. Rightly spake Prosper, No other shall come into
