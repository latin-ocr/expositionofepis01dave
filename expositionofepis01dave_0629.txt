Tertullian, advers. Psychicos, When faseing, use possess α
stronger mind, (md a heart more active to these spiritual things,
than when that mansion of the inner man ‘is glutled up with
food, ὸν drenched witlz wine. But if we think there is any
merit of satisfaction or justificatior] in these external ex-
emises, then they are not used willz knowledge, and, there-
fore, are rejected by God, as we may see Isa. lviii. 3,
where they obtruded upon God this very opus operatum in
these words, leerefore have we fasced, and tlcou seest not?
IVlzerefore have we (gfflicted our soal, aud tlzon takest no know-
ledge? God answers, It is vot suclz afast as I leave (hosen,
&c. So chh. vii. 5, 6, he denies that they fast for him
who place holiness and the worship of God ,in an external
work. But the Apostle most clearly distinguishes inl
Tim. iv. ὅ, between bodily exercise and goelliness, or true
worship. We, therefore, ought to know, that all these
things come under the head of external discipline, not of
works of divine worship.

Besides this knowledge, there is also required a due
moderatiori in all these things; for that abstinence or
chastening of the body, which hath no regard to its pecu·
liar infirmity, is foolish. Hence we read in Eusebius, lib.
5. cap. 3. that Alcibiades was reprehended because he
would not use the creatures of God, but took only bread
and water for the sustenance of his body. We see also
Timothy himself advised by Paul, 1 Tim. v. 23, no longer
to be too abstemious, but to nse α little wz'nefor llis stomaclz’s
sake and his osten z'tfirmilies. These free and moderate fasts
were in use in the primitive Church: but those necessary
and rigid ones beyond the strength of the body, were
always condemned by the wiser men. Thus Augusfine, l
De mor. eccl. cath. cap. 33, testifies, No one is compelled to
severe things which lze cannot endure ,· nothing is imposed upon
any one wlziclz he reyuses. Prudentius, l Cathemer. hymn.
post jejun. says, An open and free mode of abstinence is set
before all ; neither are we impelled by severe terror· .· it is his
own will bimls every one. Prosper, De vita contempl. lib.
2. cap. 24, says, We ought so tofizst that we mm] not be sul)-
