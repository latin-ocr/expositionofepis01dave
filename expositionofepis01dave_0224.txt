138 AN EXPOSH'lON or ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

These two virtues are the inseparable companions of
that strength and fortitude which the spirit liberally be-
stows upon us; for they are joined to that fortitude, as
secondary virtues to the primary one. But they differ in
this principally, thatfortz'tude arms us against the fear and
dread of evil approaching and attacking us, and does not
allow us to fiee and decline the fight: endurance and long-
snffeling support the mind itself against the perception of
evil which has already come upon and arrested us, and
does not permit us to sink under grief and sadness, but
teaches us to bear it without any immoderate or unbecom-
ing passion.-We see now what is the nature of endurance
and long-suffering.

Let us consider, secondly, the necessity of these vir-
tues3 and first os patience. Now this virtue is very neces-
sary to all the godly, because occasion of exercising it oc-
curs on every hand.

1. If we regard God himself, he exercises their patience
in chastising thern. Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth ;
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth, Heb. xii. 6. This
chastisement‚ if patience be present, works with it for
salvation ; if absent, produces niurmuring, desperation,
and finally, condemnation.

2. If we regard the world, patience is very necessary
to the godly : for in the world, and from the world they will
have tribulation ; and as many as will live godly in Christ Jesus
will snffer persecution. He, therefore, who is destitute of
patience, is exposed naked to the iron storm of all wea-
pons.

3. Lastly, if we regard other virtues, patience is neces-
sary. For to faith, righteousness, chastity‚ punishment is
often held out with infamy: Here patience unfolds its
strength, and exhibits itself, as it were, a shield to the
other virtues 3 for

The virtue which patience does not sustain is α widow.

Patience is so ordained in the things of God, says T ertul-
lian, that no one who is α stranger to patience can perform any
precept. Whence that saying of Paul to the Romans ii,
