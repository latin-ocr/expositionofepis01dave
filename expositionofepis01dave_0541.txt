it was deprived of original righteousness3 and now, left to
itself, follows the principles of nature. But, on the con-
trary: The darkness of the understanding, the depravity
of the will, the rebellion of the inferior passions, are not
the dispositions of the nature ordained by God ε not of the
nature, Isay; for although God had not added superna-
tural grace to nature, yet it would not have been without
natural order and beauty‚ of which, through sin, it is now
destitute. Whence Parisiensis, in tract. de vitiis et vir-
tut. cap. 5, says, that they undoubtedly err, who determine
original sin to be nothing else than a defect of grace: And
he says that it is a positive brutality innate in us, and the
cleaving of pollutions alien to our souls and not belonging
to them. What else does the Psalmist confess in Psal. li. '
5, Ι was slzapen in iniquity‚ and in sin did my mother conceive
me? Ibelieve these words will not bear that Jesuitical
comment, I was conceived in pure nature, and in no worse α
condition than Adam in his state of innocence would have been,
if God lead not further corgferred upon him tlze supernatural
gift os righteousness.

Last of all, the very words themselves on which we are
occupied, dead in the uncircumcision ofyour steslz, denote
more than a mere withdrawing of supernatural grace. For
be it that original righteousness was an armour, put upon
our first parents by God, for resisting all the darts of temp-
tati0n3 this being withdrawn‚ they would indeed be un-
armed and exposed to danger3 but not immediately wound-
ed or diseased, much less dead. But what has been said
is enough concerning this condition of death, and its
cause. Let us proeeed to the notice of the Deliverer.

Hath he quz’clcened together witlz him] That is, God the
Father who raised Christ from the dead, hath also quick-
ened us likewise with spiritual life, on account ofhis death.
Here, then, we see our Deliverer, namely, God in Christ,
by Christ, and with Christ. Nor must we wonder that
this work is to be attributed to G-od and Christ: for it is
the work both of Almighty power and goodness to quick-
en man dead in sins; and it surpasses the power of all
