which we employ this one argument. In the saints mili-
tant here on earth there is not a sulness of grace3 for it
cannot consist with so many remains of the old rnan as are
found in them: for a fulness of grace leaves no room for
sin. But not even in the very saints triumphant is there
this perfect fulness of all grace which is in Christ: For if
one star differeth from another star in light and magnitude,
then how much more does it differ from the sun? All the
blessed have the greatest measure of grace and glory which
the mind of each individual can contain3 but the mind of
any mere creature hath not that capacity, either of grace
or of glory, which Christ bath. There is fnlness in him
alone.

But an objection is raised, that the Virgin Mary, for in·-
stance, is said to befull ofgrace, Luke i 283 and Stephen
alsofull of grace and power, Acts vi, 8 : and that therefore
a fulness of grace is not peculial· to Christ.

Ι answer, the fulness of grace is twofold: One may be
regarded on the part of grace itself, when aman hath it
in the greatest extent, both as to every kind of grace, and
in the greatest perfection us to degree. This is the fulness
of Christ alone. The other regards grace on the part of
the possessor, when a man hath it as fully and as suffici-
ently as his state and condition can contain: And thus a
fulness of grace is compatible to Mary, Stephen, and
others ε For the Virgin Mary had full and sufficient grace
for that state and condition to which God had chosen
her. ’

And thus briefly have we dispatched those three points
which we proposed to explain: That all fulness of grace
was in Christ; Why all fulness ought to dwell in Christ3
and that this fulness is found in Christ alone.

Hence observe, that God is not accustomed to impose
an office upon any one, without at the same time, conferring
upon him all those powers which are necessary for the dis-
charge of it: He lays upon Christ the office of head <ff the
Churclm but he also imparts to him a fulness of grace.
Therefore, whoever thrust themselves into offices, for the
