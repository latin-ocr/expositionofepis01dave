tin, interpret the wordfirst-born of Christ, in his divine na-
ture. Therefore they would have this to be the sense of
these words: the first—born of every creature, i.e. begotten
before any thing was created, τεχθεῖς πρὸ πάσης κτίσεως, be-
cause begotten from eternity. Let us adduce a few of their
testimonies. Tertullian, in libro de Trin„ says, How could
be be the firstssborn, unless because, according lo leis divinily,
the Word proceeded from God the Fatlzer before every creature?
Ambrose, De fide, lib. i. cap. 4, says, He is called thefirst-
born, not tlzefirst-created, that be may be believed- in, as begot-
ten in respect to his natare, aud first in respect to his eternity.
Chrysostom in this place observes, ’Ou πρωτόκτιστος, ἀλλὰ
πρωτότοκος not first-created ; bntfirst-born.

But it may be said, Why is he not called thefirst-born of
God, instead of tlzefirst-born of every creature?

The construction is somewhat harsh, when we explain
thefirst-born of every creature to be begotten of God before
every creature: but the Apostle chose to connect the men-
tion of the creature with the eternal generation of Christ,
that from thence he might be understood to have been so
begctten by God the Father from eternity, as in time to
become the efficient beginning, and even the basis and
foundation of the whole creation, which, unless it depend-
ed upon him, would fall into nothing.

Thus says Basilffi He is called thefirst-born qfevery crea-
ture, because lle is llze cause (ff creation, coming inco existence
from things wlziclt were aot.

eloquent doctors of the Greek Church. He was born of highly respectable
Christian parents, who spared no pains in his instruction. After studying
at Athens, returning to his own native place Caesarea, and teaching rheto-
ric there with success for some time, he travelled into Syria,Egypt, and Lybia;
but finding there was no true rest or enjoyment to behad but In the privacies
and exercises of Religion, he returned home to give up himself thereto.
The reputation he obtained for learning and piety, occasioned at length his
being chosen Bishop of Caesarea, about the year 370, which station he held
about nine vears. He was much persecuted by the Emperor Valens, be-
cause he refused to embrace the Arian doctrine. Resides Expository, Ho-
miletical, and Moral works, Basil left upwards of 400 Letters, which, it is
said, are models of epistolary style, and replete with valuable information
