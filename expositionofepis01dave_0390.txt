304 AN EX‘POSITION oF ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

nuity was ever able to penetrate or gain access to this mys-
tery of human salvation. Unless, therefore, God himself,
who at first concealed it, had thought fit spontaneously to
reveal it, the whole human race must have lain in endless
night 3 no man could have known, none would have sought‚
for the Redeemer of the world.

A twofold reason may be assigned for the necessity of
this manifestation, arising on the one hand, from the nature
of the things revealed, on the other, from the nature of the

observes, par. 3, The eye os the soul is become tur-bid through
the infestiore arisingfrom sensuality, through the cloudiness in
the animal smaltzes, and through blindness in the intellectual-
Therefore, to sum up the whole3 The mystery of the Gos-
pel is above nature3 it depends on the eternal and secret
counsel of God. The human mind, through sin, is dete—
