tifies and guards the heart of a good man as with a military
garrison3 so Phil. iv. 7, φρουρήσει τὰς καρόἵας ὑμῶν, it shall

Secondly, as Jerome explains it, he wishes thern bro-

pentes gratiam excludunt—breaking peace they exclude grace.

of divine grace.

From the thing itself desired3

4. Paul shews us by his own example the duty of every
minister of the Gospe13 which is, not only to preach grace
and peace to his people, but from their inmost souls to
