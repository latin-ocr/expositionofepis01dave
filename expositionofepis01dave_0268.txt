182 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL's Chap. i.

ing, sor in this place, the name of God (as we have before
suggested) is to be taken with respect to person rather
than to essence.

God the Father, then, is called invisible, because (as the
Fathers with reason held) he never appeared to the Patri-
archs: but the Son, who also was invisible as to the di-
vine nature, chose to appear to them by assuming some
created form. So Tertul. in hb. De Trin. et alibi z He who
spake to liIoses was the Son of God, who always also appear-
ed to the Patriarchs. So Prudentius, in Apotheosi. Wha-
ever is recorded to have seen God, saw the Son sent foth from
him. In this manner the Son of God chose, as it were, to
give a prelude of his incarnation, the Holy Spirit also we
read of as having appeared in the visible form of a dove,
and of tongues affirm but the Father never took any visi—
ble appearance, but was always in every respect invisible.

Now the first use of this is, since God hath made it clear
that he is invisible, the heathen and papists who worship him
under the likeness of man are hence convicted of idolatry.
For God himself, inasmuch as he bath not shewn himself
visible, hath decided that he is not to be worshipped under
avisible image, Dent. iv, 15. This base idolatry of the
Church of Rome, all the Fathers, and some even among
the Papists themselves, have condemned. To worship the
divine essence iu material things, is to dishonoar it hy the senseS,

this, or else excuse themselves, saying, that “ 10 paint or grave any of the
three persons, or the three persons, as they appeared visibly and corporally,
is no more improper or unlawful, than it was indecent for them 10 appear
in such for1nS.” To this we may oppose the opinion of Tertullian, who, 111
1115 Treatise De Idololatria, shews that making mols, 110 matter of what sub-
stance, or in whatform, was idolatry3 and that building their temples 01·
altars, or adorning their shrines, though even to gain a living, was idolatry
also. But the Romish Church not only enjoins the adoration of such
images, but goes sarther, and by the ninth article of Pope Pius IV. main-
