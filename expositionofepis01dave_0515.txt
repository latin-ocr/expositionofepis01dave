Ver. 10. ΕΡιεΤιΕ το THE COLOSSIANS. 429

ped or adored by us, upon the confession of an angel him-
self3 Rev. xxii. 8, 9, Ifell down, says John, to worship be—
fore the fieec of the angel: but lte said unto me, See tlzou do it
not ,- for I am llzyfellow-servaut, and ff thy brethren : Wor-
skip God. That saying of Augustine to this effect is well
known3 We honour them by love, vot servitude, De vera re-
lig. cap. 55. And that of Parisiensis, De legib. to the
same purport3 lee angels are to be honoured, but with honour
due to tlze servant, not tlze lord.

2. Whereas we and the angels are fellow-citizens, and
members of the same body, it is inferred that angels are
not mediators between us and God. For the whole Church
is accepted of God on account of one and the same Me-
diator: but to attribute it to one member, that the rest are
accepted on his account, is contrary to reason and the
Scriptures. Whence says Augustine,' Contr. Epist. Parm-
lib‚ 2. cap. 8, that lte alone z's α IlIediatorfor whom no one in-

34, places the hope of our salvation in him, not because
we have an angel our fellow-servant, but the Son of God
seated at the right hand of the Father‚ an intercessor for

rather, that is risen again, wlzo is even at the right leand of God,
who also malcetlz intercessionfor us.

3. Since the angels are members of the same Church,
it follows from this relation of angels to men, that saith,
love, and holiness, are not gifts of the angeIS, but os Christ.
For as in corporea] generation, one part does not form and
frame another, but all are formed by one and the same
power: so, in spiritual regeneration, as Albert properly ob-
serves, our mind, in the formation of grace z's not fashz'oned hy
the angels, but by tlze Spirr't (ff Christ* But here two
things may be objected against what is said respecting
Christ as the head of angels, and men as fellow-servants
with the angels.

1. If Christ be the head of the angels, and angels be-

could exalt Divine grace, and give the proper place to angels. Oh ἔ si sic
