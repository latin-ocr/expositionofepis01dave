elements of the world designs that ceremonial worship which
was in force under the old Testament, Even we, when we
were children, were in bondage under tlze elements <ff tlze world.
And in verse 9, How turn με again to the wealc and beggarly
elemenls, sce. But Paul contends in this Chapter and the
following, with those who attempted to bring circumcision
and the other Mosaic rites into the Church, and to mix
them with the doctrine of the Gospel. This, therefore, the
Apostle says, that they are to be avoided as impostors who,
though the ceremonies enjoined by God himself under the
Old Testament are now abrogated by the coming of Christ
and the Gospel, would, nevertheless, force them upon¹
Christians. For the old law had a slzadow (ffgood things
to come, vot the express image of llze things, Heb. x. l.
In this text, therefore, we may see an intimation of thev
doctrine of the abolition of ceremonies.

The Schoolmen are accustomed to adduce a threefold
cause why it is proper that the legal ceremonies should
cease after the coming of Christ3 because they were ob-
Scure as to their signification, z’mpeaefecc as to their efficacy,
and burdensome as to their observance: for in all these
points they opposed the grace of the Gospel. But this
reason seems to me most valid, That the legal ceremonies
had a certain profession of saith annexed respecting the
Messiah who was to come, and expiate the sin of the hu-
man race. As therefore, he would sin greatly who should
declare his belief that Christ is to come and to suffer, by
professing it in words ; so he sins who does it by his deeds‚
i. e. who by those legal observances professes the same.
This Augustine shews in his treatise contra Faustum, lib.
19. cap. 16,ss Christ is not now promised to be born, to segffer,
to rise again ‚· wleiclz the sacraments of the 0ch law typified:
buc lte is announced as born, as leaving Stffired, and risen
again ,· zolzz'clz these sacraments that are observed by Clzristicms
now typq’fy. Therefore the practice of the Jewish ceremo-
nies now would be a profession of a false saith.

'⁸‘ Faustus was an Englishman, first a Monk of the Monastery of Levins,
then Abbot of the same, and afterwards Bishop of Ries. Vide Milner,
