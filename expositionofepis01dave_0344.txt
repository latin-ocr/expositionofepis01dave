verance. What remains has respect to the end and effect
of this deliverance.

To present you leoly, and unblamahle, and unreprovable in
his sight] He thus shews the end of our redemption and
reconciliation, viz. the obtaining righteousness and holi-
ness; which in many other places the sacred Scriptures
signify. Luke i. 74, 75, Thac we being delivered out (ff the
hands of our enemies, might serve God withoutfear‚ in holiness
and righteousness, all the days of 0117· life. And Tit. ii. 14,
leo gave himselffor us, tlmc he might redeem usfrom all im·-
quz‘ty, ancl purqu melo himself a, peculiar people zealous of
good worlcs.

But here the Apostle seems to comprehend a twofold ho-
liness of those that are reconciled; one which consists in
the remissiori of sins, and the imputation of Christ’s righ-
teousness 3 the other which consists in our renovation, and
in the fruits of holiness. For in both ways Christ presents
all his people holy before God. They are now strictly
saints by imputation. because they are regarded as one
mystical person with Christ their head3 but as to inherent
holffless, that is not effected instantly, but increases daily,
and acquires not the summit of its perfection before we are
translated from this life to the life of glory.

Yet we maintain that this incipient sanctification is real,
although not complete. And therefore the Apostle adds
these words, before God. For he is said to be just and holy
before God, who is so in reality, not in appearance only;
in rectz'eusle qf' intention, not infictilious imitation, as Lyra
not inaptly remarks on these words.

sophers, who entertained the most extravagant and insane opinions respect-
ing a suceession of derivative fountains of being, or existences proceeding
from the Deity, through which the stream of life flows onward to the ut-
most verge of the universe. These they call AEons, one of whom they made
the Creator of this world. Basilides attempted to blend Christianity with
the monstrous absurdities of this system. He wrote twenty-four books
upon the Gospel, and in these broached such inipieties and blasphemies of
the sliocking character of which our Expositor lias adduced a specimen.—
Valentinus, (to whose absurdities reference was made at page 250) was like-
wise an Egyptian Gnostic of the sanie period, who, if possible, exceeded
Basilides in his insane vagaries and blasphemies-notions to which one can
hardly imagine nothing but the brain of a maniae could have given birth:
