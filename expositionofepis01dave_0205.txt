Ver. 9. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 119

Parisiensis says, that tlte gift <ff wisdonz is opposed to
childislmess ; and the proper office of iltis is to produce in the
mind α. contempt of eain, and tempor-al things, and to cause ic
to take knowledge of such as are heavenly, and to embrace them
with deliglzt; but tlte gift of understanding is opposed to stu-
pidity‚· and its property is to penetrate tlze secrets of things
and their signs ; to see clearly into what are veiled in mysteries,
or sleadowed forelz z'n any manner ,· not to cleave to, orbe de-
ceived by tlte external appearances of things. It is therefore,
as it were, the acute and polished light of wisdom itself,
and without some measure of this gift, he says, no one can
attain unto salvation.

Altissiodorensis says, Wisdom is tlze knowledge of God ab·
solntely, nnderstcznding z's tlze knowledge <ff God relatively, viz.
in reyerence to the creatnres. He adds, that wisdom is the

knowledge of God hy spiritual taste, because by means of wis-
dom, tlze gracionsness of God is tasced.

Gerson says, That understanding is α certain spiritual light,
infused into creatm'esfor the knowledge of God; that wf'sdom
is a light infused, under, or by which, divine things are per-
ceived experinzentollls.

But these descriptions of the Schoolmen do not seem. to
me sufficiently ample ε for they restrict, as well wisdom as

of man, and the articles of the Christian salvati0n: they were so far appre‘
ciated by the Clergy of the time as to call forth a succession of Commenta-
tors, whence “ Theology assumed a new aspect, and instead of the divine
“ truths of the Gospel being presented to the mind, as they originally
“ were, in their native purity and excellence, they were involved in so-
“ phism and the intricaeies of metaphysical subtilty. Thorny and perplex-
“ ing arguments superseded the artless simplicity of primitive instruction.
‘⁶ The Aristotilian Philosophy itself was resorted to, and was so intimately
“ blended with the system, that the Stagyrite, and not St. Paul, became
“ the standard of authority in the Schools. The advantages accruing to
‘⁴ the See of Rome from this revolution in Theology were numerous; and
“ the Canon law, which was brought into existence about the same time,
“ while it added to the influence of the Roman See, tended to establish the
‘⁶ reign of superstition. So far was the Gospel removed out of sight at
“ this time, that it was impossible for men to see how much its beautiful
⁶⁶ simplicity was disfigured3 or what a wide departure from ‘ the saith once
“ delivered to the saints' had now taken place.‘'—Vide Grier's Epitome of
the General Councils of the Church 3 p. 182.
