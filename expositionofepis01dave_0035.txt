Liris OF Blsssot‘ DAVENANT. X'XV

“ Therein he profes-sed and declar-ed our utter dissent in that
point3 and further shewed, that by our Saviour a parity of Minis-
ters was never instituted ; that Christ ordained 12 apostles and 70
disciples; that the authority of the 12 was above the others; that
the church‘ preserved this order left by our Saviour3 and therefore,
when the extraordinary authority of the Apostles ceased, yet their
ordinary authority continued in Bishops who succeeded them3 who
were, by the apostles themselves left in the government of the
church to ordain ministers‚ and to see that they who were so or-

Magistrate and Ministry there, with undue form of government of
that chureh, whose doctrine only was offered to our opinions.

“ But, on the contrary part, it hath been suggested here at
home by some, that herein we earne short of our duty; that we
ought to have stepped yet further, by exhibiting in writing a for-
mal Protestation, to be entered and kept by the aetuary of the
Synod :—whereto we answer,

‘⁴ First, that the course there taken, for the manner of delivering
our judgrnents, was not, as in the fifth question, controverted by
subscription, but only by vocal suffrage ; which gave no opportu-
nity of putting in a written protestation3 whereas if we had sub-
scribed our names unto that confession, we would infallibly have
added, with the same pen, our exception against the articles con-
