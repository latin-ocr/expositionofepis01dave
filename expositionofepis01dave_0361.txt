And,thus much of Paul's first. reason for rejoicing in his
sufferings, viz. because of his being made like to Christ.

For his body’s salse which is the Chat-clu] This is the se-
cond reason which the Apostle gives for rejoicing in his
sufferings, viz. because great benefit would arise to the
Church from them. For so he speaks to the Philippians,
i. 12, I would με should understand, hrethren, that the things
which happened meto me have fallen out rather mtto thefurther-
unce (ff the Gospel. And again, 2 Tim. ii. lO, Therefore I
emlure all things for the elects' salse, that they may also obtain
the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. But in what sense is
Paul said to sufferfor the Church, orfor the Elam ?

He is said to sufferfor them, not to effect their redemp-
tion, or to expiate their sins; but for their edification and
confirmation in the doctrine of the Gospel. For he suffer-
ed imprisonment and bonds, not for any actual sins of his
own, but for preaching the Gospel: hence he says that he
suffered trouble for the word even unco bouds: 2 Tim. ii. 9.
Nor did Paul ever suppose for a moment that his sufferings
could purchase remissiori of other men's punishment3 but
only that his example might confirm others in a similar
constancy. For which reason in a passage above cited he
said, that he endured all thingssor the elecls' sake,- not that
they should look for satisfaction to be made for their sins
by the merit of his sufferings3 but that they might obtain
the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. In this very passage
also, immediately after mentioning his sufferings for the
Chumh, he adds, of which. I am made α minister; not, of
which Iam made a Mediator, or a Redeemer: giving us
thereby to understand that-he did not speak of his suffer-
ings as affording satisfaction, but as tending to edification.
For his sufferings had this end in view, the building up of
the Church by preaching the word and enduring persecu-
tlon.

But since the Papists pervert this passage, to ground

their doctrine of indulgences, it will not be at all irrele-
