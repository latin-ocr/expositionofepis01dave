vant to my purpose briefly to glance at the controversy on
this point.

Cajetan, in his tract, De indulgent. quaest. 3, in order to
prove that the sufferings of the saints can make satisfac-
tion for the temporal punishment due to the sins of their
fellow men, provided they be applied to them by a Papal
Indulgence, alleges this passage, and has these words:
Thac it was the inlention of the saints to segfferjbr us, the
Apostle testffies when lle says, I fill up those things wlziclz are
voanting of the segfferings of Christ for his body which is the
Church. leence it appears clearly, that tlte (livine Providence
had ordained some sufferings (ῃι tlze saints slzould have respect to
tlze completion of tlte szfferings of Christ, fbr lzis body‚· (md
that tlte saints did complete this ordinance hy tlte superabundance
of their slgffierings. Catharinus takes occasion from this
passage to descant upon indulgences copiously. The
Rhemish annotators also collect from these words that the
sufferings of the saints do make satisfaction for others, and
may be cominunicated to those who need thern on the score
of that communion which subsists between all the mem-

Let us, therefore, in a few words, propound what they on
the one side, and we on the other, have stated on this
point3 and then we shall confirm our doctrine, and refnte

this scandalous trafficking in indulgences, prepare the way

by four preliminary deceptions.

¹ lt is scarcely needful to remark that this refers to the Translation of
the New Testament, published by the English Papists at Rheims, in oppo-
sition to the authorised Protestant Translation in England, and with a re-
gular series of Annotations in ‹lefence of their own tenets, and in refutation
of those of the Reformed Churches. It was reprinted in this country in
1601, by Dr, Fulke, with the English Vei-sion annexed‚ and a confutation
of the above arguments, in a series of counter-annotations3 a work which,
containing, as it does, almost every thing that has or can be said on both
sides, is, perhaps, one of the most valuable volumes ossuch a nature in the
English language. lt was rep1·inte‹l‚ with considerable additions, in 1617
and in 16:533 the reprints are, of course, more valuable than the early co-
