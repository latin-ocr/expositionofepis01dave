346 AN ExposlTloN or ετ. PAUL'S Chap. ii.

But these words may and ought to be referred to the
thing itself to which the Apostle endeavours to persuade
the Colossians, viz. Perseverance in this true doctrine ε for
from this perseverance their hearts were about to receive

especial comfort:
1. Because the doctrine of salvation by saith alone in

Christ Jesus, brings tranquillity and peace to troubled con-
sciences. For as the modulations of harmony are wont to
be applied to revive and arouse the mind when sorrowfu13
so are the gratuitous promises of God in Christ, to bring
