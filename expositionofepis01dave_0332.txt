246 AN EXPOSlTloN of s·i.PAU1,’s Ckap.i.

With respect to angels3 as far as they are confirmed in
grace and established in the Divine favour through Christ,
so that now it is clearly impossible that any enmity should
occur between them and G0d; therefore the establishrnent
of angels in Divine grace through Christ, is the same thing
as the reconciliation of men by the same.

Neither may we doubt that the angels themselves need
the grace of Christ the Redeemer‚ that is to say, the grace
of corfirmation and exaltatior), though not the grace of
reconciliation. For, as they are creatureS, they cannot of
their own nature be beyond danger of falling. Moreover,
that heavenly and glorious union with God, which the
blessed angels enjoy in eternal life, is a benefit which sur-
passes the deserts of any creature whatever; therefore, not
even the angels themselves are admitted into this ineffable
bliss of the Divine fruition, but so far forth as they are en-
rolled under Christ, the head both of angels and men:
Whence the Apostle calls the blessed angels tlte elect,-
1 Tim. v. 21, I charge thee before the elect angels. But the
election‚ whether of men or of angels, out of Christ, can-
not be understood. To this, Ι think, refers that passage
of Job (Job xxxviii. 7) where good angels are stiled sons
(gf God, not because they are begotten of God (for Christ
is the only Son of God) but because they are adopted as
sons of God for Christ's sake. Hence, therefore, it is evi-
dent, that the grace of Christ the Mediator is necessary
for the happiness even of angels; not that by it they
should bejustified and absolved from sin, but that by it
they may be confirmed in the Divine love, aud exalted to
the glorious and abiding participation of God, which tran-
scends the power and dignity of created nature.

Now, in the last place, as to what pertains to the fabric
of the world3 it is certain, as all things were created for
man, so by the sin of man all things were in a manner
overturned, and subjected to vanity and misery. For so
the Apostle expressly teaches uS‚ Rom. viii. 19, διο. The
wlzole world waitedfor the manffestation (ff tlte sons (ff Gocl .·
For tlze creature was made subject to vanity under hope, because
tlze creature itsels also shall be delivered from tlte bondage (ff
