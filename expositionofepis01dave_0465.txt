Ver. 6. EPlSTLE 'ro THE cotossmix's. 379

Gospel: This rule Epaphras had prescribed to them: to
this rule they were bound;

1. Because they received and approved of it: For when
the Apostle sayS, as με have received (as Chrysostom well
observes) he binds them, as it were, by their own testi-
mony : for he intimates that it is not his object that they
should now receive some new doctrine, but that they should

continue in what they had received3 that not to do so, ar-
gued either folly or levity in them.

2. Because, although they must not of necessity per-
severe in every doctrine received, as, for instance, in an
erroneous one 3 yet they must remain in this, because, this
doctrine being received, Christ Jesus the Lor‚d himself was
received3 Ye have received Christ Jesus tlte Lord- In this
form of speaking there is great force, which it is proper
to examine. We must observe, therefore, that he does
not say, Asye have received tlte doctrine <ff Clzrz'sc, or con-
cerning Christ ; but, As ise liave received Christ himself. For
we not only perceive the doctrine of Christ by saith, but
we receive our quickening Saviour, and we hide him in the
heart for our salvation. And, indeed, that saying of the
Poet is known and approved by all,

It is more shamefal to eject [llam noc to admit a guest.
They could not, therefore, without great baseness reject
the doctrine or the faith received, because by that same
act they would reject Christ himself.

But that also must be noted, that he affirms they had
received Christ tlte Lord: for (as the most learned interpre-
ters will have it) the Apostle lays a stress upon this word.
For the false apostles preached Christ, and their disciples
received Christ: but those neither preached, nor did these
receive Christ tlze Lord, but the fellow-servant of Moses3
therefore they joined his doctrine with the ceremonies pre-
scribed by Moses. But the Colossians‚ and so all true
Christians, received Christ the Lord, both of their saith and
their life: nor will they suffer rules of saith and Christian
life to be imposed upon them by any one else. For the
servant cannot nianumit himself, or make himself over to
a new lord; because hc is not his own master: neither
