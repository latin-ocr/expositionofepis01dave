glory and advantage, or that they may occasion trouble and
dislike to true teachers. So the Scribes and the Pharisees
opposed Christ and his doctrine, that they might establish
their own vain traditions‚ and that they might obtain ho-
nour among the unthinking multitude. These impostore
are the most wretched of all mortals3 for, as Cyprian
writes, Epist. lib. 2. epist. 1, tlte souls of all those to whom
by their deceivings they have been tlze authors and leaders to
perdition, will be required at their hands in tlte day cffjudg-

There are others who deceive the people by their so-
phisms from ignorance3 for their own minds, too, are en-
snared by the same devioes with which they endeavour to
ensnare others. And these sophisms for the most part pre-,
vail among those in whom a preposterous zeal, void of
knowledge, predominates. In this catalogue we may
reckon those who, inflamed with a certain pious affection
towards the saints of God and holiness itself, were at

imagine and require that the saints should be worshipped
and invoked ; to oontend that even the kingdom of heaven
is acquired by the fruit of their good works3 and to hawk
about these their sophisms every where with the greatest
ardour for true doctrine. Among this number even they
also are to be accounted, who, burning with a just hatred
against all superstitious worship, because God will not be
worshipped by the commandments of men, are hurried away
with such a zeal as to maintain that all rites, all the ordi-
nances of the Church, even concerning things indifferent,
are to be rejected and exterminated. But we should take
care not to be imposed upon either by the one or the other:
for both attempt to ensnare others, being deceived by their
own sophisms. Honeyisgood, says Gerson, with the hones-
