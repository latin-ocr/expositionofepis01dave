the Mosaic circumcision : which, if it be compared to this,
is plainly a thing of no worth, Rom. ii. 28, and Phil. iii. 3.
But here it is to be observed by the way3 that the Apostle,
when he disputes about circumcision and the other Mosaic
rites, speaks of them, for the most part, as they are con-
sidered in themselves, apart from Christ, and not related·
to Gospel grace3 because they were so urged by the false
apostles with whom he disputed. For they sought righ-
teousness and sanctification in the ceremonies themselves,
neither did they acknowledge that there was concealed in
them the shadows of Christ to come3 on that account they
would not allow them to be abrogated by the advent of?
Christ: The Apostle, on the contrary, argueS, We have-
that spiritual circumcision which the bodily one shadowed·
forth3 therefore, that ought now to cease, lest, while we
would retain the shadow, we deny that the body itself is
come.

It is objected, The Apostle’s reason does not seem solid:
for he thus concludes, Ye are circumcised with the circum-
cision made without hands, therefore ye need not that which
is made with hands : Any one from among those teachers
of the ceremonies might rejoin, Nay, we need both: for
Abraham was circumcised in heart by saith and the Spirit,
yet he did not decline to undergo external circumcision
besides.

We answer3 The case is not the sanie. For Abraham
by virtue of the Divine command was bound to corporeal
circumcision; Christians are not bound z Abraham by sub-
mitting to this sign declared and confirmed his saith con-
cerning Christ, to be born of his seed, free from all sin ;4
but we do not look for Christ to be born, but believe that
heis born: finally, Abraham had no other sign of the co-
venant entered into with God; we have, namely, baptism,
substituted by God himself in the place of circumcision-
From what, then, has been said concerning the Author and
the modeof our circumcision, we may derive some instruc-
tions.

1. Christ being taken away, there remains nothing in
the sacraments but an empty shew, and a ceremony strip-
