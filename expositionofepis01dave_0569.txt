are unwilling so to bind their consciences, that if by acci-
dent, or infirmity, or any other reasonable cause, they
should act contrary, they should be accounted despisers of
the magistracy, much less violaters of the Divine law.
Gerson, in Regulis moralibus, observes, No man is bound
by tlzefasts of the Cburcb when under known itfirmily of body,
scmzdal being excluded. And Erasmus, in Tract. De arni-
bili eeclesiae concordia, sayS, lee constitution oftlze Cleurclt
by no means binds those who incur danger from eating fisb, or
wb-ofind that fasting iiijures tlze healtlz of llze body, or the vi-
gour <ff tlte mind. In fine 3 it accords not with ecclesiasti-
calor magisterial polity‚ to prescribe choice of meats at
certain times, upon the plea of necessity, or sanctity, or⁴
merit3 but because it is consistent either with public good,
or reason, or the example of the saints, that certain per-

public utility, politicians may see to that: but I affirm

for tlzis day is holy milo our Lord: so also is it lawful and
decorous, when there is cause of signifying public grief or
penitence, to abstain from delicate food, and from those
other things whereby the body is wont to be cherished and
delighted. This we find observed by Daniel, chap. x.
verses 2, 3 3 Ι was mourning tlereefull weelcs. I ate uo plea-
sant bread, nez'tlzer came fleslc nor wine in my mouth. This
also was the use in the primitive Church, yet so that, as
Augustine testifies, no one should be urged to severities which
lle could not bear ; nor tlzat be imposed upon any one wlez'clc he
refused, De morib. eccl. lib. l. cap. 33.

Let these things suffice for resolving the first doubt.

2. As to festival days3 it is objected that the Jews were
even bound to the observance of them after they had ein-
braced Christianity, because God commanded the festivals
instituted under the old Testament to be observed for ever,
