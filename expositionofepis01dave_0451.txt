the human nature, upon the acknowledgment of Chemnitz
himself, would turn out Divine z* for since the properties of
Divinity are not accidents‚ but the essence of God himself,
they cannot belong to, neither are they communicated‚ i. e.
fot-mally, habitzcallJJ,orsubjectivelps. But no other mode besides
tlte essential and occidental can be desired ε therefore the attri-
butes of Divinity‚ among which our opponents themselves
assign omniscience, are not communicated to the human
soul. But they say they are communicated by an hyposta-
tical union. Yet this is nothing to the purpose. For the
attributes of the natures are not transferred from one to the
other by virtue of the hypostatic union3 but the attribute
of one nature is ascribed to the other in the concrete, for
the sake of the ideutity of the thing supposed. As when
we say that God suffered, or was crucified‚ or was born of
a virgin3 that the man Christ was omniscient, omnipotent,
the Creator of the world : predications of this kind are
true, not because the Divine nature in itself in any manner
admits the possibility of suffering3 or the human nature
the attribute of omnipotence and omniscience ε but because
that man who suffered was God3 and God who is omnipo-
tent, was also man in unity of person.

nent Lutheran Divine, who flourished about the same time with Andreas,
in the Duchy of Brandenburg, to the Prince of which he became Librarian.
To the learned Martin Chemnitz's examination of the Decrees of the Coun-
cil of Trent, the history of Religion, says Mosheim, is more indebted than
many are apt to imagine. He died in 1586, at Brunswick, leaving behind
him several important works, especially the ground-work and commencement
of an elaborate Harmony of the „four Evangelists, with a Commentary on
the same, which was afterwards completed by other hands, and is held in
high repute on the Continent. Of this harmony and his other theological
writings, Leigh, in his treatise on learning, asserts, “ they are most profit-
able, especially that excellent work, or rather most rich bibliotheque, which
contains both a refutation of the Council of Trent, and also an explication
of the whole doctrine of the Church; to be read daily by all to whom the
knowledge of the truth is welcome.‘'
