Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 21

dication to the Divine worship: whence we call not only
men, but temples and vessels, holy; because they are set
apart to sacred uses in the worship of God. In both these
respectsa baptised Christian is rightly called a saint.

For, first, he is in baptism cleansed from original cor-
ruption, ancl the imputation of all sins. Whence it is
called, in Titus iii. 5, tlte laver (ff regeneration. And in
Acts ii. 38, it is said, Be baptised every one of you for tlte
remissiore of sins. Hence also that saying of Nazianzen, The
water cleanses tlte body visiblzs; the Spirz't accompanying ic
also invisibly cleanses the soal. Hence also that ancient cus-
tom of putting white robes upon baptised persons3 by
which ceremony they signified the purification of their
souls effected by virtue of holy baptism, as Lactantius ex· .
presses in that line, De Pascha v. 93,

Fulgentes animas vestis quoque candida Signat .-

Lz'lcewise the white raiment belok-ens their resplendent souls.
Neither does this purification consist alone in the wash-
ing away of sins, but in the combined infusion of spiritual
graces3 of which subject parisiensis elegantly writesfiss

Priest of Damieta, anciently called Pelusium, in Egypt. He left 2012 let-
ters, said to be written in a very superior style, on scripture doctrine, dis-
cipline, and morals. :Mosheim commends him as avoiding the allegorical
mode of interpretation, so prevalent in that age3 and assei-ts that his epis-
tles discover more piety, genius, eruditiori, and wisdom, than are to be
found in the voluminous productions of many other writers. An edition of
his letters in Greek and Latin, in folio, was published at Paris, 1638.
Might he not have had in view, in the above remark, the rite of ceremonial
cleansing under the Law, as dwelt upon in Heb. ix. 12—22?

’¹‘ The person here quoted under the epithet ‘ Parisiensis,' was William
of Auverne, created Bishop of Paris-in 1228. He was one of the most
learned schoohnen ofhis time; being eminently skilled in theology, philoso-
phy, and mathematics 3 he was also distinguished for his piety ς and was more-
over perhaps the most useful writer of the thirteentli century ; for whilst his
contemporaries were occupied in verbal quibblings and metaphysical intrica-
cies, his works were directed to the promotiones practical godliness, the

least understood of all sciences in that age of erudite ignorance and theolo-
gical wrangling.
