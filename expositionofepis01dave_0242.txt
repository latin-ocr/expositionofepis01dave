word, from the state of corrupt nature, under which all
those things are comprehended; or, as others are accus-
tomed to say, from the darkness of ignorance, of unrigh-
teousness, of misery. All these come to the same point:
we need not, therefore, labour for words.

W'e are said to be delivered from the power of darkness,
because we are delivered from the power of the devil, who
is the prince of darkness, and labours more and more to
darken and to blind his snbjects. We all are born under
his kingdom and power, so that before our deliverance he
worketh in us according to his own will. Thus in Ephes.
ii. 2, Wherez'n in times past με walked according to the prince
of this world, Wherefore one of the Fathers said, That a
throne, as it were, was erectedfor the devil in the heart of every
angodly man: and those who are not yet liberated he
terms, the horses of the devil; because he drives chem hither and

the feet of the faithful, Rom. xvi. 20, to whom, by the
Spirit of God, new strength is administered to trample
upon this unclean spirit.

2. God hath delivered us from the power of sin, which
hath blinded the understanding‚ corrupted the will, and
placed us in a condition of darkness both as to knowledge

ness; iii. hat men have loved darkness, viz. the darkness both
of ignorance and wickedness. Now from this darkness
God has rescued us, whilst he pours in the light of faith,
whilst he imparts the Spirit of holiness3 which blessings
being bestowed, this power and dominion of sin is dis-
solved. Ἀμαρτισι ὐμων s κυριέυσει, Rom. vi. 14, The body of
sin is destroyed, that henceforth yse should not serve sin, ver. 6.

Lastly, He hath delivered his people from the power of
hell, i. e. from the mise-ries and calamities which arise from
the guilt of reigning sin. For hell is described as a place
of darkness, Matth. xxv. 30, Cast με him into oater dark-
ness. From the power of this infernal darkness they are
delivered by the Divine mercy,for there is no condemnation
to them who are in Cla-istesus, Rom. viii. 1. In every case,
