fulness of the Godlzead5 and it is the height of madness to
require new teachers after him.

2. Whoever‚ therefore, wanders out of Christ, or mixes
any other thing with his doctrine as necessary to salvation,
he accuses Christ of imperfection, and denies the fact that
all tlte fulness os tlze Godlaead dwelt in kim.

3. This we observe in the Turks and Jews, who are not
content with the Gospel doctrine, because they do not be-
lieve that all thefulness qf' the Gocllzead (lwelt in him who
proclaimed the Gospel. As to Papists, who, being fasci-
nated with novel and marvellous error, acknowledge that
m⁷l tlzefulness of the Godltead rs in Christ, yet deny that all
the fulness of salvation is contained in his doctrine, I know
not what to say. ’

Before we proceed to the mode of this indwelling, let us
briefly resolve a doubt which may arise in the mind of some,
from the Apostle’s words. For when he asserts that all the
fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, he seems to say
that the entire essence of the Deity assumed to itself this
habitation of the flesh of Christ, and, therefore, that not
only the Son, i. e. the second person in the Trinity, but
the Father also, and the Spirit, were incarnate.

The Samosatenians,²¹² who deny a Trinity of persons,
think that they can drive us to this difficulty, viz. that if
we affirm a Trinity, we shall be also compelled to admit
that the three Per-sons were incarnate, because the fulness

of the Godhead‚ i. e. the entire and perfect Divine essence‚
‹lwelt in Christ incarnate.

’⁸‘ Samosatenians, or Paulianists‚ so named from Paul of Samosata,
Bishop of Antioch in the latter part of the third century. These heretice
maintained that the Son and Holy Ghost exist in God as the faculties of
reason and activity in men; that Christ was born a mere man: but the
Reason of the Father descending into him caused him to be called the Son
of God, and did by him work miracles and instruct the people. Alas 1 how
many Heretics of this cast, or of the grades mentioned in the two preced-
ing Notes, exist among us and disti-act the Church in the present day. The
theological Student, however, would do well to ascertain the way in which
these heresies were niet at the time of their first rise, by consulting Dr.
Burton's invaluable work before referred to, ‘⁸ 'l'he Testimonies of the
Ante-Nicene Fathers to the Divinity of Christ.”
