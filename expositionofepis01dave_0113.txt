In Christ Jesus.] The Apostle has dignified the Colos-
sians with the brilliant titles of holiness,fi(z⁷elitzj‚ brother-
lzood: now he shews from whence they obtained these so
eminent endowments‚ viz, from Jesus Christ, the author and
giver of them all.

First, as to our holiness: we are rightly called saints in
Christ JesuS, because only by the Spirit of Christ, and by
virtue of his blood, are we cleansed from our sins. and
sanctified m the sacrament of baptism. The water repre·
sents externally the pledge of grace3 but the Spirit inter-
nally works the works of grace, August. Epist. And upon
Psalm lxxxvi. Preserve my soul for l am lzoly, the same
Father says, If thou skalt say that thou art bolis ofthyself} thou
art proud ; Agaz'n, being a belz'ever in Christ, and α member
of Christ, if* thou skalt not ‹ze-knowledge thyser to be lzolzs
thou art ungrateful.·-- Say unto God, I am holy, for ΤΙιοιι
least sanctffied me. Moreover We are called saints in Christ,
because not only does he effect our sanctificatum, but by
a gratuitous imputation he communicates to us his righ-
teousness and perfect holiness, Phil. iii. 9.

SecondIy, we are also calledfaitlficl in Christ Jesus ; as
well because true faith always looks to Christ Jesus, and
acknowledges him the only Mediator and Saviour of the
human race, as because that Christ by his Spirit works in
us both our holiness and our saith.

Lastly‚ as to our brotherhood3 we are also called ble-
thren in Christ Jesus. For whether we be called brethreu on
account of our agreement in faith and religion, Christ is
the only Teacher of the Christian faith and of religion3 or
on account of brotherly affection, Christ hath shed abroad
this love in our hearts3 or on account of God being the
common Parent of us all, we are adopted through Christ
