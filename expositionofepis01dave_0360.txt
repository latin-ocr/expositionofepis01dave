274 AN EXPOSlTlON or sT. PAUL'S Chap.i.

God has allotted to be borne by him after the pattern of
Christ, though for another purpose. Upon this passage
Lyra makes no bad comment: The suff'erz'ngs <ff Christ are
taken in α twosold sense ,· in one‚for those which he actually sus-
tained in his own body, ‘in th‘ch nothing renzains to be com-
pleted: in the other, for those which he should sastaz'n in his
mysticat hod-y, even to the end of the world ‚· and thus there re-
mains the residue of many sufferings still to be completed.

What has been thus observed upon the sufferings of
Paul, and, by parity of reasoning, of all the faithful, viz.
that they are accounted the sufferings of Christ himself,
tends

1. ΤΟ strike terror into the ungodly. Whilst they are
afflicting the Church, they think that they are only vexing
a few pitiful and contemptible men. But the real fact is
far otherwise; for they are wounding Christ himself (who
is the Head of all believers) in his members. Vengeance,
therefore, the most inevitable and bitter‚ awaits them ς see-
ing that they are provoking the L01 d of glory himself, to
whom all power is given in heaven ancl in earth, Matth.
xxviii. 18.

2. To the honour and dignity of the godly. For surely
an honour and dignity it is to be received into the fellow-
ship of the sufferings of Christ. Therefore we read in
Acts v.4l‚ They rejoiced that they were connted worthy to
snffer shamefor the name of Jesas: And in Phil. i. 29, To
‘yon it is given not only to believe in him, bnt also to snfferfor
hz's salec. Nazianzen says, reason prescribes that we rather
honour than clespise the afflicted. And why should we not
regard them as highly honoured who are preferred above
others to a participation of Christ's sufferings, as it were
to a participation of the royal cup3 and who drink of that
cup, indeed, of which Christ drank first?

3. To the great consolation of the pious. Because it
confirms their hope of obtaining future blessedness. This
is α faithful saying, [f we he dead with Christ we shall also
live with him ; {s we snffer with him we shall also reign toge-
ther with him, 2 Tim. ii. 11, 12. Whence Gregory re-
marks3 The more sorely I am horne down by present evils, the
