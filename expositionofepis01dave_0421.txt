Clzap. ii. EPISTLE To THE COLossmNs. 335

3. An hortatory conclusion3 in which he advises them
to obey the truth. nor suffer such great solicitude of an
Apostle for their salvation to be in vain3 in verses six and
seven.·

From the construction of this Exordium I venture to as-
sert, that there is no rule laid down by Aristotle, Cicero,
and other masters of eloquence, concerning the framing of
introductions, which is not adhered to in this brief open-
ing. For three things are required by them in a legitimate
Exordium : That it be adapted to render the hearer atten-
tive, and docile, and to conciliate his qffection. We render
our hearers attentz've when we shew them that we are about
to speak of great and unusual things, or which relate to
those who hear. The Apostle excels in all these respects;
for what is either greater or more excellent than the mys-
tery of God, the treasures of Christ? What either to be
more wondered at, or more dangerous than the speeches
and deceivings of impostors and their arts? Lastly, What
more properly concerned the Colossians than that spiritual
consolation, and the riches qf understaudz'ng, which is pro-
mised to them at the threshold of this address? These
things, therefore, are sufficient as to attention.

Now as to what pertains to docility ; Rhetoricians direct
that in an Exordium, the sum of the subject to be treated,
and the points of proof‚ should, as it were, be scattered by
the way ε for it ought to be ὁδοποιησις ’ἴω 'emm-1 λογω, α paving
of tlte way for tlze discourse that is to follow, as Aristotle
wisely says in Rhetor. 3. 14. This the Apostle effects in
verses 3 and 4. In the former he lays down the ground of
his defence3 in the latter he confutes the reverse by stig-
matizing it with the name of imposture-

Concerning the great art of conciliating their good-will
much need not be said ; it abundantly shines forth in every
sentence. He conciliates their good-will to himself from
his own personal character, by relating what labours he
had undertaken for them, and what benevolent feelings he
always entertained towards them; from the personal cha-
racter of his adversaries, by reciting their impostures and
frauds3 and from the personal character of the Colossians
