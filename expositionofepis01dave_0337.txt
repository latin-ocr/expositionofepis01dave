Ver.2l. EPlSTLE 'ro THE cotossmns. 251

7, The carnal mind is eumity against God ,· for it is not sulqject
to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Secondly, the
heathen and the wicked are said to hate God, even directly,·
not in that they conceive him to be the Creator and Preser-
ver of the universe (for that is impossible), but to be a law-
giver, ajudge, and an avenger.

But man under sin is said to be an enemy to God in ano-
ther sense, viz, inasmuch as he is odious and hateful to
God : For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alilce kate-
ful unto God, Wisdom xiv. 9. 'l‘herefore, whilst the Colos-
sians were under a state of sin, they were under the divine
wrath and hatred. Rightly said Augustine, on those words
of our Saviour, John iii. 36, He that believetlt not tlze Son,
the wratlt qf' God abicietlz οη him .· not, it will come upon him,
but ic abidetlz on him, for long since it fell upon all tlze clzz'l-‘
dren of Adam, the burden of ic lies upon them, until it be re-
moved by Christ tlze Mediator.

Nor is it wonderful that wicked and unholy men should
be accounted enemies to God, since God himselfis most holy
and pure. We consider one thing friendly to another, which
bears a resemblance to it in its virtues, says Plato, De leg. 8.
Since, therefore, after the fall, so great dissimilarity took
place between God and men, they were of necessity alien-
ated and enemies. Therefore,

1. Since as many as are not yet reconciled to God by
Christ, are lying in so miserable and grievous a condition,
we should hasten to get out of this state of perdition, and
strive with all labour and prayer that we may be translated
into a state of salvation.

2. Since God alone hath power to rescue us from this
state of condemnation3 as many as perceive that they are
delivered and received into Divine favour, should give
continual thanks and render unceasing obedience to their
Deliverer.

Thus much with respect to the misery of the Colossians,
and, consequently‚ of all men under sim*

'¹ What a powerful argument arises from these obse1·va¹ions for Christian
Missions to tbe heathen! But even the good Davenant does not appear to
have been alive to this consideration.
