lii [ΑΒΕ or BISHOP DAVENANT.

a fourth, Germ-ude, to James Harris‚ Esq. of the Close, at
Salisbury, from whom descend the present Earls of Maluisbury.
There was probably some connexion, though I have not been
able to trace it, between our Prelate and Sir William Davenant‚
the profligate Poet-laureate os Charles I.; sor lzz's brother Robert
was Chaplain to the Bishop‚ and presented to a Stall in Salishury

Cathedral.

 

Lloyd, in his Memoirs, has given an Epitaph on our Bishop,
which, as exhibiting a good summary of his genius and character,

we here subjoin.

‘⁶ Hic jacet omnigenae eruditionis modestae
Epitome. Cui judicium asservit
Maxime discoetiorum,
quicquid uspiam est literarum Hebraicarum
Ethnicarum, aut Christianarum
Omnes linguas, artes et historias
quicquid praedicarunt
patres, disputarunt scholastici

decreverunt consilia
in sobriam pacificam, et practicam concoxi't
Theologiam.

Quae in concionibus dominata est, Scholis
Imperavit, et Synodis* leges dedit
Prudens pariter ac simplex,
ille, ille cui severior vita quarn
opinio ; ut pote strictius vitam
agens, quam sententiam, (Doctrina
magna lux Ecclesiae, exemplo major)
Cujus libri omnes una hac notabantur

Inscriptione Pnffirmm QUI PROFmT,
qui Regem venerebatur, sed et timebat
Deum) non tam suo, quam publico morbo
succubuit Aprilis 3, 1641, extremam
in haec verba agens animam :—

‘ Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.' '³

² ⁶‘ Bogerman confessed that Dr. Davenant's experience and skill in the*
laws and histories, gave them directions for the better order-ing of their

debates and votes.”
