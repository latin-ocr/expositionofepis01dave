Ver. 8. EPlSTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 407

Thus the Apostle exploded the doctrines of seducers3
thus we explode the traditions of Papists, which they urge
as necessary to salvation-

2. These things are deniecl to be after Christ, not only
because they did not proceed from him, but because they
lead Christians off from him. And they lead them off in
two modes :

l. By exercising and detaining the mind elsewhere. For
through its innate curiosity, the human mind more readily
engages in these new and strange doctrines than in Evan-
gelical simplicity, especially when they are obtruded under
the pretext of Religion. He, therefore, who shall have
brought his mind to these new doctrines, begins forthwith
to grow weary of the Gospe13 according to that saying of
the Apostle, 1 Cor. i. 23, We preach Christ crucg‘fi'ed, to tlte
Greeks foolz'slzness.

2. They also lead it off by offering a hope of salvation
in other things. For because it is much more easy to per-
form some external works than to believe truly in Christ,
and as soon as a hope is afforded of obtainingjustification‚
the remission of sins, and eternal salvation in these works
of human tradition, Christ is forthwith forsaken‚ and the
greater part agree to run to these external aids. This is too
clearly perceived in the papacy, where almost all hasten to
saints, to indulgenoes, to expiator-y masses, to personal
satisfactions, whilst there are few who flee to sincere peni-
tence and saith, i. e. to God in Christ3 for these traditions,
which are not after Christ, have led almost all from Christ.
