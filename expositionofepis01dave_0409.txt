of sound doctrine, but also the holding itfast, that he may be
able to instruct others in sound doctrine, and to convince tlte
gainsayers. But let those who neither can nor will do this,
see tlze Iieavy guilt that they bring upon themselves by witlzslzold-
ing the word <ff instruction from their brethren, and by depriv-
ing dying sauls of the remedy of lg'f'e; as Gregory remarks in
Pastorali.

’ Thus, then, have we discoursed of the primary object,
and also of the manner of apostolical preaching· ‚ in which
the Apostle embraces three things, viz. the zoarmng and
doctrine.- the persons who ought to be taught, viz. all men:
and lastly‚ the matter which ought to be preached to peo-
ple, viz. all saving wisdom, And now we w'illrpass on from

the manner to the aim 01· pulpose os the Gospe] Ministry. -«

leat we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.]
Behold, then, the end and aim of Paul, and so, indeed, of
every other Minister of the word3 viz. that they may bring
all kinds of people to that saving knowledge of Christ in
which Christian perfection consists. Now to avoid confu-
sion herein, let us make two separate explanations. The
first as to the intention of Paul3 the other as to Christian
perfection, or the character which constitutes it.

In respect of the first, then, it is asked, Is not this
intention of Paul either extravagant or absurd, it being
most certain that the greater part of mankind will not be
brought to Christ after all the efforts of the Gospel minis-
try? For though many are called, yet few come, i. e. are
chosen. Why, then, does he profess an intention which
never can be fulfilled?

I answer, Neither is the Apostle¹s intention of bringing
all men to Christ, though few will in reality be brought,
nor are his endeavours tofulfil it extravagant or vain.
That it is not extravagant there are two reasons: l. Be-
cause it is in conformity with the rule of Charity, for ac-
cording to that rule we are. to presume favourably of every
man until the contrary is shewn: But Ministers have no
evidence against any particular man being saved3 therefore
they are bound to entertain a good hope for every man, and

to do every thing they can for promoting his salvation.
