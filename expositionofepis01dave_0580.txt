494 AN EXPOSITION or s'r. PAUL'S (Ἰηιρ. ii.

3. Because as the shadow represents the body very ob-
scurely and imperfectly3 so those legal ceremonies repre-
sented Christ.

4. Because as the shadow by itself avails nothing, nei-
ther can; but it is the property of the body to act, and to
exert its own power: so those ceremonies by themselves
could avail nothing to the remission of sins, sanctifica-
tion‚ and salvation3 but all the efficacy of salvation is
from Christ.

These things being established, viz. that the ceremonies
were shadows, it remmus, in the last place, to shew, that
Christ having exhibited the body of these shadows, it is
right that they should now be done away z

First, Because, as Augustine properly remarks, The me-
thod to be observed in our obedience towards God, is, that what-
ever God directs in appointz'ng particular times, is so to be ob-
served as lze directs it. Now God, in his wisdom, so directed
times, that he would have shadows, and the discipline of
a tutor, to prevail until the coming of Christ3 but when
Christ, the Sun of righteousness, arose, he would have
those shadows to fiee, and the meridian light of the Gos-

iv.; When we were children, we lived under those elements as
under tutors: but since Gocl hatlz sent leis Son to deliver us, we

Therefore‚ as it would have been contemptuous‚ not to use
these ceremonIes under the Old Testament, when enjoined
by God himself, so it is folly to desire to use the same now
under the Gospel, when they are done away by Christ
himself.

Secondly, because means are used in order to an end3
and the end of the ceremonies was the utility of the signi-
fication, which has now ceased and that for two reasons:
first, because the things which were signified as future, are
no longer future, but accomplished : therefore, they would
be false shadows, since they would assume that to be fu-
ture, which is past. Secondly, because the doctrine of the
Gospel now clearly propounds all those mysteries which
were only obscurely suggested by the ceremonies. Let the
