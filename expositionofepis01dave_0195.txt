Ver. 8. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 109

The first, a general one, which regards the very nature
of love: to wit, because the Holy Spirit is the author of
it; and also because love flows from a spiritual heart, i. e.
from a beart regenerated and renewed.

Hence observe the dignity of Christian love. For natu-
ral love, or predilection‚ arises from those inclinations which
they call στοργάς φυσικάς, natural affections. Worldly love
arises either from views of interest or from conformity of
manners; carnal, from the appetite for pleasure: To all
these something corrupt, sordid, and vicious always ad-
heres. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and
is altogether full of holiness and purity.

The other reason why the love of the Colossians is said
to be in the Spiric, is special, and hath respect to Paul
himself3 For, as we have before said, they had never seen
Paul, but had only heard of him through Epaphras and
others : because, therefore, they had loved him whom they
never saw in the flesh, they are said to love in tlte spirit.
Therefore the word spirit is taken in the same sense as in
l Cor. v. 3, Being absent in tlze body, I am present with you
in the spirit, διο.

Hence observe, that the duty of every good man is, to
embrace with spiritual love all good men, although known
only by report. That any one may be esteemed worthy of
our love, it is sufficient if he be known in respect to his
virtue, although he be unknown in person.

And thus far we have been employed in explaining the
first and second part of the exordium. The last remains‚

which is comprised in the three following verses, 9, 10,
ll.
