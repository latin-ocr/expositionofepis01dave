the African Bishops is no less than that of the Romam* If
however they will not hear Cyprian, yet they will not re-
ject the Council of Nice, which restricts that OEcumenical
Bishop within his own limits3 vide Can. 6.†

Lasssy, an universal and apostolic Bishop may every
where ordain Bishops and Pastors of his own right: but
if the Pope should ordain a Bishop out of his own pro-
vince, that would not be a lawful ordination ; for so it was
held by the Synod above-mentioned. It is quite clear that
if any one be made a Bishop without the consent of the
Metropolitan, that Synod determined him not to be a
Bishop.‡ Cajetan meets this argument ridiculously, by

in 1825, observed in the Church of St. Maria della Modestia (formerly a
Temple of Romulus), in the Via Sacra, an inscription in Italian literally
thus: ‘⁴ The portrait of the most blessed 'Mary over the high altar spoke to
Pope St. Gregory saying, ‘ WVherefore dost thou no longer do me rever-
ence?‘ The Saint asked pardon, and granted to those who celebrate Μειεε
at this altar the liberation of a soul from purgatory, i. e. of that soul for
which the Mass is said.'' It is thus the Church of Rome has drawn to her-
self that wealth whereby she has maintained her power. Gregory was most
severe in the point of celibacy of priests3 but discouraged the persecution of
the Jews.

’⁹ Cyprian was Bishop of Carthage about the middle of the third century.
The whole passage from which the above sentence is cited runs thus:
‘⁶ Neque enim quisquam nostram Episcopum se Episcoporum constituit, aut
tyrannico terrore ad obsequendi necessitatem collegas suos adiget-'⁹ It con-
tains, as Bishop Kaye, in his Ecclesiastical History, p. 239, well observes,
“ remarkable expressions,'’ and is evidently “ aimed at some Bishop who
had called himself Episcopus Episcoporum.''

ἦ· Council of Nice: Canon 6. “ Let ancient customs prevai13 as forin-
“ stance, those in Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis .· That the Bishop of Alex-
“ andria have power over all these, since the same is customary for the
“ Bishop of Rome. Likewise in Antioch and other provinces, let the pri-
“ vileges be secured to the Churches. This is as manifest as any thing at
“ all, that if any be made a Bishop, without the consent of his Metropoli-
“ tan, this Great Synod has determined that such an one ought not to be
“ a Bishop. If any two or three, out of affectation of dispute, do contra-
“ dict the Suffrage of the Generality, when duly passed according to Eccle-
“ siastical Canon, let the Votes of the Majority prevail.’'
