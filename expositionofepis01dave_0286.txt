his glory, not indeed as the price of his lahour, nor as pri-

For every creature as it hath come forth from (iod, so it
returns to him as far as it can, as Boethius has expressed
itin those 111105, De consol. lib. iv. metr. 6,

Quia non aliter durare queant,

Dulican’s Boethius, 1789.

¹· Boethius, Anicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus, the author of the
above 111105, was a prose as well as a poetical writer, descended from one of
the noblest fzunilies in Rome, and born about the year 479. At an early
age he discovered excellent parts; and to enrich his mind with the studv of
philosophy, as well as to perfect him in the Greek language, he was sent to
Athens. Returning to Rome, he was soon distinguished, and promoted to
the principal dignities in the State, being 01105011 10 1110 consular dignity
three times, created a Pati-iciam, and made Master of 1110 Offices. Though
living ir· great affluence and splendour, 110 studied theology, mathematics,
ethics, and logie ς and 1115 success in each of these bravches appears from his
works still extant. The great offices which he bore in the State, and his
consummate wisdom and infiexible integi-ity, procured him such a share in
the public councils as to give rise tojealousies‚ which led to plots and in-
trigues to 011001 1115 111111. But the unpl<>ymeiit ofhis pen in the defence of
11110 Religion, and against the Arian lieresy, which then prevailcd in Italy,
appears to have afforded those who felt his infiuence and hated the
truth, the strongest ground against him. Three chiefs among the Arians,
whose errors he had exposed in a treatise, ⁶ De Unitate et Uno,' and who
were in that period a persecuting body, with whom Theodoric took part,
at length succeeded in turning the mind of the Monarch against him,
Whilst he was engaged in a distant part of the western enipire, they alleged
against him a treasonable correspondence with ,11151111 1110 Emperor ofthe East ς
