394 ΑΝ ΕΧΡΟΞΗἾΟΝ or εἰη mois>- (Ἰιαῃ. ii.

The abuse of natural reason, or philosophy, in the cause
of religion is manifold.

l. When it attempts to deduce the fundamentals theni-
selves of religion from its principles. For although the
principles of right reason are true in themselves, neverthe-
less there cannot be elicited from them what is to be cle-
termined concerning the mystery of the Trinity, the incar-
nation of Christ, the justificatior] of a sinner, invocation
of God, and his worship3 all which things are to be de-
duced from higher principles, namely, fron] the will of
God revealed in the WVord. Reason is the discursive power
wlziclz proceedssronz principles to conclnsz'ons: but it does not
possess in itself the principles of those things which are
apprehended by faith3 therefore, it daringly builds conclu-
sions upon the sand of its own opinions.

2. W'hen it opposes its own principles, which are true
in the order of nature, to theological principles, which are
far above the order of nature. For exaniple3 it is true,
that out of nothing, nothing can be made ; it is true that dis-
similar species cannot be preslicaced (gf each other, and cannot
unite in tlte same subject ; it is true there is no retnrnfrompri-
ration lo possession: but all these things are to be under-
stood according to the course of nature and the power of
a finite agent. Philosopliers therefore err, when they
think that they can hence conclude against 1116 creation of
the world, the incarnation of God, and the resurrection of
the dead; all which the Scriptures teach as done, or to be

’ done, not by virtue of natural causes, but by the Almighty
power of God. Here, therefore, that rule of Aquinas,
Quaest. disp. de fide, art. 10, is to be retained, Tleeologjzs
can never contradic( trae natural reason, hnc osten rises above
it, and thus APPEARS to oppose it. For true reason does
not affirm that those superior things cannot be effected ab-
solutely; but cannot be effected by any finite power3 and
this theology likewise confesses. In those matters, there-
fore, which are of this kind, philosoph-«y, as says Clemens,
Strom. 1, should submit z‘tself to tlzeology, as Agar to Saralz ;
should allow ilself to he advised and correctecl: bnt 3'f it be
unwilling to become obedient, cast ont the lzandmaid.
