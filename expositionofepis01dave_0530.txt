bute these supernatural effects either to the external ele-
ment‚ or to our own strength. Therefore, the death. bu-
rial, and resurrection of Christ is the cause of our mortifi-
cation and spiritual vivification. l. It is the cause merito-
rz'oasly, as was before contended for by us at the 18th verse
of the first Chapter3 because, by his death and resurrec-
tion, he merited for us this rnortification and spiritual ris-
ing again, as it is said Isaiah liii. 10, Is he slzall lay down
lzz's soulfor sin, he shall see a lasting seed-²* For because he
laid down his natural life, he merited to raise up a spiritual
seed to himself, and to communicate spiritual life to them.

that we were dead and rise'n again witlz him, and z'n lzinz ,-
because, by tlze merit, efficacy, ancl exan‘eple of his death
and resurrection, we have obtained mortification and spiri-

tual resurrection.

Hence we observe,

1. Christ is not dead, buried, and raised again for him-
self alone3 but for us : for in his death and burial he hath
mortified and buried our sins, and in his resurrection he

the quotation from the aforementioned text, “ If lzz's soal shall malfe apropi-
