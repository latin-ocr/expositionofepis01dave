history, that it is wonderful to see it asserted by a learned man
not unacquainted with antiquity.

Be this, therefore, fixed and established, that among many
Presbyters, who in some one city administered the word andsa—
craments, there was one set over the rest by the Apostles them-
selves, and armed with a certain peeuliar dignity and power.
These Bishops‚ being thus established by the authority of the
Apostles, it is certain were succeeded in a perpetual series by
those who were substituted in the same eities; and, when it seemed
good to the Church, new ones also were constituted in other
cities‚ after the same example.

But, in the last place, we must observe in what consisted this
excelling dignity and power of 'Bisbops, by which they were dis-
tinguished, not by their own presumption, but by Apostolical or-
dination, from other inferior Presbyters. And here it must be
candidly acknowledged, that Bishops have certain privileges above
Presbyters, which are derived, not from the primitive constitutions
of the Apostles, but either from the especial beneficence of Chris-
tian Princes, or from the authority of Councils; and of such, we
say with Jerome, in his dialogue against the Luciferians, These
are ratherfor honour to tlte Prz'estkood‚ than of legal necessity.

But of Bishops there are three peculiar marks by which they-
are readily distinguished from other Presbyters, and recognized
as superior.

The first is, that in cities, however large and populous, wherein
many Presbyters were created, the Apostles ordaiued one Bishop
only, at whose decease another succeeded singly in the same See.
Hence that 'decree of the Council of Nice, Let there not 'be two
Bishops in one city. Hence Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, re-
proaches Novatus with ignorance for not acknowledging the sin-
gleness of episcopal succession: This Vindicator of the Gospelis
ignorant that there must be one Bishop in that Church, in which
Ize is not ignorant there areforty-sz'x Presbyters. Euseb. vi. 42.
If the Apostles approved a parity of all ministers, why would they
have one to be distinguished from all the rest by this singleness of
succession? Jerome, who is esteemed not very favourable to
episcopal dignity, nevertheless confesses, that with this single-
ness of succession, a singular dignity and eminence was joined.
For thus he writes, (in Epist„ ad Evagrium,) concerning the Bishop
of Alexandria, At Alexandria, from the Evangelist Mark down
εό the Bishops Heraclas and Dionysius, the Presbyters always
