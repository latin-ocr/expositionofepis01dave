18 ΑΝ EXPOSITION oF ετ. PAUL's Clzap. i.

3. The Church would not be governed in the best way
unless it were governed by one supreme spiritual head3
but Christ left the Church instituted and governed in the
best manner3 therefore by one.

Ι answer3 Christ alone is the spiritual Sovereign of the
whole Church; but to institute an earthly sovereign, on
whose will the whole Church should depend‚ would be the
worst mode of governing the Church3 because no mortal
can discharge that office even moderately well. For how
shall the Pope sitting in the Vatican, take care of the
churches of the Indians or the Ethiopians? But that Pon-
tiff does not aim at the care of churches, but at empire.

4. The Church is always increasing, and it must in-
crease until the Gospel be preached in all the world: but
this cannot be done unless there be one chief president, on
whom the apostolic charge and trouble of preserving the
whole Church and of extending it, may devolve3 for no
one ought to preach unless he be sent; and no particular
Bishop can send beyond his own province.

Scripture, much akin in fallacy and plausibility to the one above, but ma-
naged with more ingenuity. For, with the most artful sophistry, carried
on through two pages, he labours to prove that the words of our Lord to
Peter, recorded John xxi. 15—17, “ Fecd my lambe ,· fied my slaeep,’' were a
commission to Peter, in the first place to govern the faithful intended by
the lambs,· in the next, ajurisdiction over the pastors of the faithful, con-
veyed in the words “Feed my slzeep.'' The consequence, he concludes is,
that ‘⁶ since Christ gives Peter a superintendence over his whole flock, he
confers upon him a jurisdiction distinct from that of the rest of the Apos-
tles—a jurisdiction more enlarged than theirs—a jurisdiction reaching over
the whole body of the Church, over the taught and the teaehers, over the
governed and the governors.'' So that, as the Rev. Joseph Fletcher, in his
excellent volume of “ Lectures on the Principles and Institutions of the
Roman Catholic Religion,'' justly observes, “ according to this arguing the
⁸ lanibs' mean the ‘ sheep,’ and the ⁶ sheep' mean the shepherds l ἱ !'’ It is
to be believed, that this is the general mode of Popish instruction. The
recently published discourses of a neighbouring Priest, under every cau-
tionary restraint, might be adduced as containing abundant evidence of the
truth of the assertion3 and, inore recently still, a distinguished Papal
Orator, in the town where the Translator writes, was heard, in his ordinary
pulpit exercises, labouring to establish his auditory in the belief of the
doctrine of Transubstantiatim, by attempting to prove, that it was tlte uni-
form and universal belief ⁰f tlte Cltre'sllans qs ilcestrst fonrccntzcries ⁰f the Chris-
tian era fl!
