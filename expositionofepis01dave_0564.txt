478 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειΤιοΝ oF s'r. PAUL's Clmp. ii.

Apostle in the eighth verse advised us to beware 0f3 for
against all these respectively he draws the conclusion3

1. Against the Mosaic ceremonieS, which were urged by
the Judaizers3 verses 16, 17.

2. Against curious and superstitious doctrines about

now delivered from this yoke by the death of Christ: Let
no man thereforejudge you, i. e. acknowledge no man to

have this power.
In meat or in drink] He instances in certain particular

part of their holiness3 but since there is a like reason for
those which are here named by the Apostle, and for all
others, he would have us understand that all were abro-
gated together. As to ›meats; it is certain from Levit. xi.
that there was a distinction of meats to the Jews under a
precept, so that by virtue of the Divine appointment they
were compelled to abstain from some. In drinlc also, they
