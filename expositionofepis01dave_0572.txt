to be celebrated by a public offering of thanks: which
cannot be conveniently done, unless they who govern the
Church or the State prescribe appointed days in which we
may assemble3 See Joel ii. 15.

Secondly, Reason admonishes us, that to render the re-
membrance of past benefits more efficacious‚ they should
be recollected (if it can be commodiously done) at that
very time in which they were originally bestowed: for a re-
collection of the day itself excites the mind to a more at-
tentive consideration of the benefit. Hence that injunc-
tion of God to the Jews, Exod. xiii. ὃ, 4, Remember tlzis
(lay ite whiclc ’με came out of Egypt, &Q This (lay, Isay,
came με out, iu tlte mouth ΑΜΖ).

Thirdly, the interest of the people recommends it; By
occasion of these festivals, the chief mysteries of our sal-
vation are opened to tlie1n3 which we may see in the ser-
mons of the Fathers, who always treated those subjects
which were connected with the institution of the feasts
themselves. Thus Nazianzen, in sanct. Pentecost. says,
Ozcrseczses are celebrated in ιι, spiritual mamzer ;jbrec1clzsolem-
mty leatlz its peculim· ίεηᾱεηςιμ as the word leallc lo those wlco
allend upon llic word.- but that is the most pourerful out of the
word, wlziclt is hest sailed to tlte time.

Fourthly, the examples of the pious confirm it. For in
the old Testament besides the festivals appointed by God,
we read that others were introduced on occasion of new
inercies: the feast of Purini, or oflots, instituted by Mor-
decai‚ and approved by the Church, Esth. ix. 27: the feast
of Dedication, in memory of the reparation of the temple,
and of the deliverance from the tyranny of Antiochus, l
Maccab. iv. 59. Which feast Christ himself honoured by
his presence, John x. 223 and, doubtless, he never would
have done that, if he had considered a feast appointed by
man for the recognition of Divine benefits to be unlawful.
Therefore the Church, relying upon these reasons and ex-
aniples, hath rightly judged that certain holy days should
be appointed for the public worship of God, and for the
public celebratior] and acknowledgment of benefit'sreceived
from God.
