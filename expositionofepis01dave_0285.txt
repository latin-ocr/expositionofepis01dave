Ver. 16. EPISTLE To THE conossmns. 199

that there are four first-formed and coeval things, viz. the
angelic nature, the empyreal heaven, shapeless matter, and
time.

3. Because Jude says, verse 6, That the angels who kept
not thei'rfirst estate, but left their habitation, are reservedjbr
jndgment. Here heaven is called the habitation, or dwell-
ing-place of angels; and it is not very likely that angels
should have existed many ages without 3 dwelling-place
peculiarly their own. We conclude, therefore, thatMoses
when asserting, In the beginning God made the heaven ared
the earth, and the Apostle when affirming that all things
were 'made by Christ which are in heaven ancl in earth, visible
ancl invisible, had both exactly the same meaning.

All things were created by him and for him, καὶ εἰς ἀυἹὸν.]
The Apostle here, by repetition after 3 long parenthesis,
resumes his first position, that all things were made by
Christ. On these words, I need add nothing further than
my former observation, that εν αυτω, and δι αυτου are synoni-
mous terms, and are henceforward put one for the other in
this resumption of the statement.

The Apost1e‚ however, was not content with the plain
and simple repetition of the former assertion3 but in order
to amplify the dignity of Christ, he adds, that not only
were 311 things made by him, butfor him, or on his account.

Forhim.] Here then he shews that Christ is not only
the efficient, but also the final cause, on whose account 311
creatures were made.

But how were 311 things createdfor Christ? That they
might minister to his glory3 inasmuch as t'hey shew forth
his Divine power and infinite goodness, and inasmuch 33
311 things are subservient to him. For God does not act
from 3 wish destitute of an end, 33 men do, but from love
of an end to be accomplislied, which, 33 far 33 is possible,
he is pleased to communicate to his creatures. Christ pos-
sesses, and in 311 fulness‚ infinite glory fron] all eternity;
but in creating the world he manifested this his glory to
us, and laid on 311 his creatures the obligation of glorify-
ing him. Hence the Psalmist, in Ps. cxlviii. beginning
with the angels, runs through the whole scale of creation,
