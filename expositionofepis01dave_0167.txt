Lastly, if our hope be laid up in heaven, there ought
our mitid to be perpetually directed: for where the treasure
is, there is the heart, Luke xii. 34. That saying of Paul is
the saying of every true Christian3 We have our conversa-
tion in heaven, from whence ire lookjbr the Savionr, Phil. iii.

faithful person, even upon ear-lh, verges upon α celestia] nature

things hath taken possession of us, that that saying of
Prudentius may justly be turned upon us,

celestial blessedness. It is necessary to say something
concerning this interpretation, inasmuch as the words bear
it, and many interpreters follow it.

¹¹ Surely this was a Christian Poet, who in this couplet had in view Isaiah
lxiv. 73 and may not the Apostolic appeah Col. iii. 1, be allowed us here,
“ If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.'’

The sense of the above quotation is thus attempted for the advantage

of the mere English temler:-
Regardless of its lofty birth, the mind
Ne'er wakes a thought th' Almighty Sire to find 3
Ah ἔ who with ardent longings soars on high
To gain th‘ eternal realms beyond the sky Ξ
