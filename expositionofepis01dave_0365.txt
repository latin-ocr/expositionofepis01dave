Ver.24. EPISTLE To THE cotossmns. 279

plainly shews that he keeps the guilt itself in rement*
brance. Moreover, when the guilt and the punishment are
proportioned‚ as the measure to the thing measured, then,
whatever quantity of expiatory punishment is required, the
same quantity of sin committed is imputed. Therefore the
first proposition, which supposes that Christ hath obtained
for us a half remission, is false. Christ, says Augusfflne, bis
imputing to us the punishment which he safferecl, without am]
guile φ( his own, laath cancelled both the guill aad the punish-
ment.

2. None of the saints either had superabundant merits,
or bore sufferings greater than their sins deserved. There-
sore it is absurd to look to them for a borrowed satisfac-
tion for those punishments which we deserve from the jus-
tice of God. They had no superabundant merits‚ because*
no man ever yet hath perfectly satisfied the divine law

comment on Ps. xci. 14, observes, with equal nobleness of
sentiment and piety of heurt, The sum lolal of mcm's merit
is this, lofix all lais hopes on him by whom salvation is com-
plete, Tom. l. To this you may add, that the merits of
even a holy man are in no way equal to the purchase of
eternal happiness3 and, therefore, most foolishly do the
Papists look for a superabundance, in those in whom it is
impossible to find an equivalent. Nor, indeed, did any of
the godly at any time suffer punishment more extensive
than their sins. For God always inflicts punishment short
of what the Schoolmen call cos-:dignily; because infinite
punishment is due, as the Papists themselves admit, for a
single mortal sin, even of-the least degree. The second
opinion, therefore, of the Papists, which ascribes penal
sufferings to the saints, severerthan the demerits of their
own sins, falls to the ground.

3. The merits and sufferings of the saints cannot be
communicated to others in such a manner‚either by imputa-
tion or application of them, asto free them from the punish-
