seelc or avoid them. And Durandus, To believe in God is not
simply an act offaith, but the act qffaitlz and love together.

From these considerations it is manifest, when the Pa-
pists argue that true saith may be separated from love,
they are either playing upon words, or opposing their
own Schoolmen. For that saith which is void of love,
differs in kind from that which is justifying3 for the last is
a theological virtue, the other is not ι they differ in the
object3 for this apprehends God reconciled to usin Christ3
that is not able to apprehend any such thing r they differ
also in their effects 3 for this brings peace to the con-
science, that fear: they differ, lastIy, in their acts; for
the act of this is to believe in God‚ the act of the other is
only to believe God, as We have before shewn.

The last question, which has respect to faith and love,
remains3 viz. Whether love be so conjoined with saith that
it is the form of saith? So it appeared to Thomas, to Du-
randus, and to others of a more recent date. For they

thing, and whatever it hath of life or merit, to be borrowed
from love as from its soul and form.

But on the other hand, Altissiodorensis (whomI have
often named)²* opposes this, lib.v3, where he maintains, that
true and formed faith naturally prece—des iro-ve3 and he ad-
duces the following reasons:

l. The just lives by faith; therefore he loves by faith3
therefore living faith is prior in its nature to love, and
hence itis not formed and enlivened by love.

2. From l Tim. i. 5, The end of the commondment is love
out of α pure laem-t, and offaitlz unseigned: therefore true
saith, and that which purifies the heart, produce-s love3
and by consequence it is not formed from love.

3. The motion of true faith precedes the motion of

‘ The person often cited by Davenant under the epithet of ‘⁶ Altissi'o-
(lorensis,” was william Bishop of Auxerre, whose Theological Summary is
far superior to the general style ofDivinity of the twelfth century, in which
he flourished. Though little is recorded of him, his character and excel-
lence as a WVriter and a Christian, are quite evident by Davenant's quota-
tions from him here, and especially under the lssth verse.
