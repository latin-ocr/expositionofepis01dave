thee, and thou shalt glorify me. But the Papists call upon
angels and saints3 they think that they can be delivered by
their aid 3 and, finally, they honour them for their deliver-
ance. Now, truly, all these things are proper to God
alone3 to be every where present, and to hear the prayers
of all that call upon him, to deliver supplicants from im-
pending evils, to bestow gifts, and, lastly, to be adored
with religious honours for this his compassion. Since,
therefore, in the very act of invocation, these things are
ascribed to saints and angels, latria, or Divine worship, is
paid to them. Upon this, Tertullian, De orat. cap. l,
writes, that Christ taught us that our religious itztreaties should
be ‹ffired to him alone whom we believe every where to hearand
to see us. And advers. Marcion, 4, They who supplicate
another god, and not the Creator, do not pray to him, but dis-
honour him.

2. To make a vow to another, is an act of latria, due to
God alone. Isa. xix. 21, and Psal. l. 14, Qffer mtto God
thanlcsgiving, and pay thy vows wito the ,Most High ; and Psa,
lxxvi. ll, Vow aud pay meto the Lorsl your God. Aquinas
himself, Q. 2. quaest. 88. art. l, thus defines a vow, A vow
is α promise ‘made to God, by which we dedicate the things pro·
mised to the Divina service. But now the Papists cannot
deny that they may make vows to angels and saints.
Whence, in the profession of the Friars Predicate, that
formula of vowing is customary, I vow to God, and to the
blessed Mar'y, and to all the saints, διο. Nay, when in any
danger, they utter some vow to the saint whose aid they
implore. What does Bellarmin say to all this? The vow
is made to Godfor α token of gratitude towards the first cause
of all good things ; but to saints or augels, as α taken eff gra-
titude towards the intercessors by whom we receive benefils from
God. But this does not excuse the idolatry; because,
whatever be the intention or reference, an act of latria
cannot be offered to creatures. For what Bellarmin says
of vows, might be said of sacrifices under the Old Testa-
ment, viz. That sacrifice was to be made to God alone, in

token of gratitude and obedience towards the First Cause 3
