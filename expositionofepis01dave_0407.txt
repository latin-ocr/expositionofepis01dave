wise and to the unwise.

That he might avow his zeal, and declare how his affec«
tions were bent upon the salvation not of this or that man,
but of all mankind. For as a physician makes it the busi-
ness of his profession to cure not this or that individual
only, but all that he can3 so the Physician of souls exerts
himself (as much as in him lies) to give relief to 311.

Τ1113 example of Paul must be imitated by 311 Ministers
of the Gospe13 who, though not commissioned like him to
teach all nations, yet should be animated with the aposto-
lic purpose of bringing to Christ 311 those who are committed
to their superintendance. This very purpose they ought
to exhibit in warning and teaching every man placed under,
their ministry. They are not to think lightly of the poor,
nor to be intimidated by the great, so 33 to shrink from
their bounden duty both of teaching and warning. leo-
ever, says Augustine, disobeys the commands of God and dis-
regards reproof} is on that very account to be reproved, because
he will not bear reproqf. De corrept. & grat. cap. 5.

In all wisdom] This is the last expression we have to
consider as to the manner of apostolic preaching3 viz. that
he had concealed nothing, but had instructed every man in
all wisdom. The expression all wisdom, however, is not to
be stretched beyond the limits of the present subject3 but

· only to be applied to all wisdom of a saving nature, or such

as is necessary for salvation. He does not profess to teach
worldly wisdom, which is attained by the light of reason3
but heavenly and spiritual, which is discerned by the light
of saith, and is contained in the doctrine of the Gospel.
Whatever, then, was necessary to be understood for ob-
taining salvationi through Christ, that the Apostle openly
expounded before all men. “ That this was Paul's meaning
in this passage, is evident from the collation of other places
in which he also declares the same persevering zeal in in-
structing the Churoh. In Acts xx. 18, &c. Ye lcnow how I
