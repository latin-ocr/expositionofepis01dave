shewn. But neither does the exposition agree with the
truth of things itself3 because that limbus, placed at the
borders and brink of hell, in which they think the fathers
were kept, as ina dark dungeon, till the death of Christ,
is a mere fiction. For howsoever the Schoolmen, in 3.
Sent. dist. 22. obstinately niaintain, that the ancient fathers
were excluded from heaven, and thrust into limlms5 and
Bellarmin‚ De Christi anim. cap. 16, asserts, that Christ by
his descent into hell conferred upon the fathers that bring-
ing them forth out os tlzat prison, and leading llzem lo heaven,-
nevertheless we, relying upon truth itself, deny this ficti-
tious place; we deny the devil to have been spoiled in this
sense, viz. that the patriarchs were translated out of his
dominion to heaven by Christ after his passion.

Although I would not rashly affirm that the bosom (ff
Abraham (which they likewise call limbus) was the very
seat of the blessed, to which the souls of the pious pass,
since Christ by his blood hath consecrated a new way, Heb.

likely that a pious soul was carried to some part of heaven,
than thrust down to the borders of hell. 2. Because it is
said, Dives being tormented in lzell list up his eyeS, ancl saw
Abraham afar qff, and Lazarus in lais bosom, ver. 23. It was,
therefore, a place situated above, not beneath. 3. Be-
cause it was a place most full of consolation: for thus
Abraham addressed the rich man, ver. 25, Remember that
thou in thy lifetime receivedst Νη] good thingS, and lz'lcewise
Lazarus evil things,· but now he is conzjbrted, and tlzou art
tormenled. But limbus is affirmed by the Papists to be a
dismal place, most remote from essential blessedness.
Lastly‚ because a great gulplz z'sfixed between this place and
hell, ver. 263 but between hell and limbus, i. e. the mouth,
and, as it were, the nearest part of hell, there cannot be
said to be a great gulph fixed.

The passion of Christ had the cternal fruit of salvation
