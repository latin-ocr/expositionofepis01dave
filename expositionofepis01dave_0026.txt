discussions. Carleton came into direct collision with Gomarus
upon the subject of our seventeenth Article and upon other points ;
and the testy Hollander could not help exclaimfflg, Reum-endis-

sz'me PraesuL non auctoritate sed ratione ayendum esc: for which in-
temperance an apology was afterwards exacted. However, the
doctrine of Redemption as a blessing to be universally proposed
and offered to all nien, was so little relished by the Synod‚ that
itis clear, nothing but the threatened loss of the English deputies
induc-ed its insertion. In fact, it led to so much unpleasant dis-
cussion, that it appears the Bishop would have given way: but
Davenant declared he would sooner cut off his hand than rescind
any word of it; in which he was supported by Ward; and it was
ultimately agreed to. Our Author assigned his “ Reasons’' at
length; and they are printed in John Hales’s “ Golden Remains‚‘’
at the end of the “ Letters concerning the Synod of Dort.’'* In
fact, Davenant appears to have been peculiarly eminent in these
proceedings. “ What a pillar he was,'' says Bishop Hacket, “in
the Synod of Dori, is to be read in the judgments of the British

Divines, inserted among the public acts: his part being the best
in that work; and that work being far the best in the compliments

of that Synod.”
At the close of the business, they received the public thanks of

the States-General and of the Prince of Orange; and having tra-
velled a short time in different parts os the Dutch territories, they

that '³‘ they held that the Redemption of Christ was universal, and conse-
quently‚ that salvation was attainable by all-'⁹ If this be α consequence,
it is certain that neither Davenant nor the Synod allow it. His “ Reasons''
expressly maintain the contrary ς and the articles of the decrees which ad-
mit the one, are immediately followed by an article which denies the other.
The two articles, for which the Synod is indebted to our divines, run thus:
(Cap. ll. art. 5, 6) “ The promise os the Gospel is, that whoever believes
in Christ crucified shall not perish, but have eternal life. Which promise,
together with a command to repent and believe, ought to be announced and
offered, promiscuously and indiscriniinately, to all men and people, to whom
God, according to his good pleasure, sends the Gospel. But that many who
are called by the Gospel, do not repent, nor believe in Christ, but perish
in unbelief, this comes not from the deficiency or insufficiency of his sacri-
fice on the cross; but from their own faultss’ Art. 8, then says, ‘⁶ It was
the most free counsel and gracious will and intention of God the Father,
that the quickening and saving efficacy of the most precious death of his
Son, should appear in all the elect, to cntlow them alone with saving faiths'
