136 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’S Chap. i.

2. It is called glorz'ous power on account of the admir-
able mode of conquering the devil, the world, and the
flesh. For the Spirit of God not immediately, by his ab·
solute power, beats off these enemies of our salvation ; but
by inspiring us with strength causes even ourselves to
trainple them under. Moreover that power must necessa-
rily be very admirable and gloriouS‚ which makes feeble
man, clothed with sinful fiesh, to overcome the insults
and wiles of devils, the alarms and solicitations of the
flesh, the hatred, snares, and injuries of the whole world.
Of this glorious power God himself speaks, My strength
z's made perfect in wealcness, 2 Cor. xii. 9. Vide l Cor. i. 27.

Only one thing now remains to be explained: How this
glorious power of the Holy spirit comes to us. It is de-
rived unto us by the gracious mediation and intercession
of Christ sitting at the right hand of the Father. Con-
cerning the gift or sending of his spirit into the hearts of
believers, we have the promise of Christ, John xvi.7, It z's
expedient for you tlzat Ι go away, sor, g'f Ι go away, I will
send the Comforter wzloyou. Christ, therefore, as God, to-
gether with the Father and the Holy spirit, gives this glo-
rious power of the Holy spirit to his people. God alone
gives God. Christ, as man, intercedes with the Father,
and by his intercession obtains this Spirit of fortitude for
all the elect: John xiv. 16, Iwz‘ll ask tlte Fatlzer, and he will
give you another Comforter, that lze may abide with you sor
ever. f

Hence we gather that Christ, although seated in heaven,
is yet the living head of, and really united to, the Church
which is on earth. For as the natural head diffuses sense
and motion through its body; so Christ, the spiritual head
of the Church, communicates the vital power of his Spirit
to all his members.

Here we see the real practical use of that article, He
sittetlz at tlze right hand (ff the Fatlzer .· For we do not be-
lieve as we ought the sitting of Christ at the right hand of
the Father, unless we believe that he so reigns in heaven,
as far more effectually to protect and strengthen his people
