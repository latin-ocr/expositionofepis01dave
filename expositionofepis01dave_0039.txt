‘ Declarant clarissimi Magnae Britannicae Theologi, se Confes-
sionem Belgicam diligenter examinasse, nihilique in ea deprehen-
disse, quod ad fidei quidem dogmata attineret, quod verbo Dei
non consentiret. The Divines of Great Britain declared that
they had diliyently examined the Belqz'ck Confessi0n‚ and that
tleerez'n,f0r as much as concerned Doymatical points offaith,
they found nothing} that ayreed not with the word of God ,·’
which reservation implieth that somewhat else which did not ⁴ con-
cern points of faith‚' but other matter, received not their appro-
bation. It may be said, and so we ourselves say, that the dis-
posers and puhlishers of these Synodical acts had done more
right to the Eritish Divinas, if special mention had been made of
that other matter not approved by thern, and of their particular
exceptions against the articles which concerned church govern-
ment. ’

“ But it seemedr, as in most other local passages in this Synod,
the actuary here intended abridgement, in what he set down; and
meant not to express in particular What was said by any, concern-
ing points not propounded to Synodical deliberation, especially
touching upon so tender a thing as the open impeachment of their
own established discipline: and so they think that they have given
us our due herein; partly by thus pointing afar off to what we did
in our own defence‚ leaving the reader to find it by implication;
and partly by recording that all Synodical proposition and appro-
bation of this confession was confined to matter of doctrine
only.

‘⁶ According to reserved form of expression, the President of
the Synod, in the Great Church of Dort‚ immediately after the
publication of the Synod's judgment upon the five controversies,
notifying the approbation of this confession, said, not that the
whole and every parcel was approved, but ⁶ Doctrinam in confes-
sione comprehensam, in Synodo relectam atque examinatam, ut
orthodoxam, &c. fuisse approbatam.’ Which style of speech ex-
cludeth whatsoever is there comprised not concerning doctrine but
discipline, whatsoever was not examined Synodically, nor so
much as read in the Synod, whatsoever in common understanding
admitteth the title of Orthodox‚ which attribute is proper to dog-
matical points. In this sense, and of this subject, they did and
well might there alledge the concording judgments‚ ‘ omnium tam
exterorum quam provincialium Theologorum.'
