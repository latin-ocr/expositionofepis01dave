efficacy of love.⁴ For as that fire is hotter and stronger
which not only is able to warni things that are near, but
such as are far remote3 so that love is the more perfect and
lively, which not only extends to neighbours, but to those
most distant, i. e. to enemies. Neither ought we to think
this love of enemies to be a matter of advice, but of corn-
mand3 for he loves not God above all things, who does not
love an enemy: which may be thus demonstrated ε

In every enemy of ours two qualities are found: one
which is a ground of love, viz. a participation of the di-
vine likeness‚ and the possibility of his participation of
blessedness: another which is the ground of hatred, viz.
that he inflicts an injury upon US, and opposes us: if there-
fore, setting aside the ground of love, we are altogether
converted into hatoed, our enmity outweighs divine love.
Now, as to men openly wicked, such as are given to drun-
kenness, adultery, perjury, Christian love does not desert
even these. For love hopeth all things; 1 Cor. xiii. 73 it

in Vaticanae Aula describi coloribus jussit a Georgio Vasaro Religionis vin-
dicatae monumentum, et de profligata haeresi trophaeum, sollicitus indequam

ers of Dr. Lingard, if the credit of the Papal historiari had not been suffi-
ciently disposed of by Dr. Allen.—On the subject which it is here wished to
impress upon the consideration of the thoughtful Reader, if he still doubt
of the true character and tendency of l’opery, let him only peruse the last
chapter of Mendham’s “ Literary Policy of the Church of Rome.’' Indeed
the Translator would intreat every one who has not read that volume, and
who desires to come to a right conclusion about the real character of the
Infallible and unchangeable Church, to procure it for that purpose. It is
of vital importance to a decision in the mind of a wavering Protestant, as
to the light in which he should view Romanism and its efforts at the present
time. It is more than probable, that on closing the volume, after perusal,
his mind would recur to recent events in France as affording a practical de-
monstration of the reflections with which its statements close. It isa fact,
moreover, pretty well accredsted, that the recent Revolution there was oc-
casioned mainly by the intriguing of the Priests with the Court party, and
by their attempts to introduce that system of things, which in this country,
and iu Ireland‚ they are ever and anon insinuating that the Protestant
Clergy are interesteu in u pholding.
