mei-its of Christ, they would procure remission of sins, let
the cause of their being granted be ever so trifling. Vid.
Gerson, par. 2. tract. de indul.

But now let us meet the arguments of our adversaries.
And here they discover a singular hardihood3 for though
they themselves acknowledge that indulgences cannot be
proved from Scriptum, yet do they endeavour to wrest
many parts of Scripture to this purpose. As for instance,

due to sin, independently of any satisfaction of our own
by indulgence: therefore, Paul could, and therefore, also,

less than Paul's was. Aquin. Suppl.3. part. q. 25. art. l.

I answer, The Apostle is here speaking of a certain Co-
