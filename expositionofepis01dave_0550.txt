464 AN EXPOSITION OF sT. PAUL's Chap.ii.

Rom. iii. 20. 3. Because, after it hath proved us guilty of
sin, it denounces against us the sentence of condemnation
and of malediction: For this is the sentence of the law,-
Cursed is every one that contimreth not in. all things which are
written in tlze hook ‹ffthe law to do them, Gal.iii. 10. There-
fore, on all these accounts, the law of God considered in
its rigour, and as far as it hath the power of binding to
perfect obedience, and of condemning, is hostile to man-
kind, and, as it were, a bond attesting our infinite debt,
and giving power to the creditor of condemning us, and of
casting us into prison, whenever it shall be his pleasure.

Now, with respect to ordinances, or the ceremonial law,
which were annexed to this hand-writing, those legal insti-
tutions were also contrary to men:

l. Because they were almost infinite as to number, and
most burdensome as to the observance. Whence that re-
mark of Tertullian, advers. Marcion, 2. cap. 19, God load-
ed tlte Jews with those legal dz'scz'plines, that he might subdue
their obstinacy, aud mould them by toilsome duties. And on
this account we are admonished in Gal. v. l, to stand fast
in our liberty, and not to be again entangled with that yoke
of bondage.

2. They were also contrary to men by their significa-
tion and testimony. For although they seemed to promise
the destruction of sin, yet there entered into them a con-
fession rather than an expiation thereof3 especially if any
one regard them not as seals of Gospel grace, but as ap-
pendages of the law itself, and parts of legal righteous-
ness. But in this sense they were pressed by the false
apostles with whom Paul contends; as manifestly appears
from this, that they would not allow they were abrogated
by the coming of Christ and the fulness of the grace of the
Gospel.

Ye perceive‚ therefore, in what sense those ceremonies
were contrary to us3 viz. because they were both burden-
some, and also signified and admitted that the hand-writ-
ing of the law had been violated by us. On these accounts
it was the height of folly to impose those ceremonies
