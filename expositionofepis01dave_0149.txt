Ver. 4. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANs. 63

1 quaest. 45, art. 6, thejustffication of α sinner pertains to the
goodness and the mercy of God superabundant& dzffusing it—
self. But we neither can, nor ought, to seek or apprehend
the. goodness and mercy of God, independently of the
promises of grace, which are made and ratified to us in
Christ the Mediator: therefore in these alone, as in the
proper object, the act of justifying faith is exemised,
when and as far as it justifies.

Semndly, it is evident from the distribution of the
Scripture3 for it is divided into the Law and the Gospel ε
butjustification is not sought or contained in the doctrine
of the Law. Not in that part which prescribes obedience
and promises a recompence to those fulfilling its corn-
niands3 because the conscience of every one witnesses,
that we cannot be justified by the legal covenant. Much'
less in that other part which contains the threats and pun-
ishments due to those who violate the law3 because this
doctrine affords not the hope of salvation, but inspires the
dread of hell. It remains, therefore, that justification be
sought in the Gospel, i. e. in the promises of grace3 and
the act of faith, as far as 'itjustifies, should be especially
directed to these promises.

Thirdly, we shew this from clear testimonies of Scrip-
ture. Acts xiii. 38, 39, Through Christ is preached thefor-
giveness of sins ; aad by him all that believe are justffied from
all things from which με could not be justified by the law of
ffiloses, And Rom. iii. 21, 22, But now the righteousness of
God without the law is manffested, being witnessed by the law
and the prophets; even the righteousness of* God which is by
saith qs Jesus Christ wito all and upon all them that believe.

Iargue these points the more at large. because Bellar-
min, Dejustif. lib. i. cap. 8, &c. says, thatjustifying faith
is a general assent to all things which are contained in the
word of God; and makes, not the promises of grace, but
the whole revelation of God, the object of this saith. 1f
he intends, that justifying saith assents to the whole divine
word, we willingly concede it: but if he denies that it has
a certain principal object in the word which it regards be-
fore all others in the act itself of justifying, viz. Christ
’ the Mediator, and his gratuitous promises concerning the
