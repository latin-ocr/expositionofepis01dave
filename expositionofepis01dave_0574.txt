488 AN EXPOSlTION OF s·10PAUL’s Chap. ii.

who bestowed upon Apostles and Martyrs whatever they
either had or did, or endured, worthy of praise. This is
clear by the practice of our Chureh. For in those festivals
which are distinguished by the names of the Apostles, we
do not worship the Apostles, or offer incense to them, or,
finally, invoke them3 but we invoke God alone, and offer
thanksgivings to God for those benefits which we have re-
ceived by the ministry of the Apostles.

5. We must not imagine that the outward performance
is a worship acceptable to God, so that nothing else is re-
quired by the law of feasts than to ceasefirom daily zoor-ks,
and attend the sacred rites; as Bell-annin, De cultu sanct.
lib. 3. cap. 10, would have it; but we must much rather
consider that internal operationis are required 3 namely, ces-
sation from the works of sin, elevatior} of the mind to
God, grateful recollection and consideration of those bene-
fits in remembrance of which festivals were instituted : If
these things be wanting, we mock God by the outward so-
lemnity of a holy day. Thus spake Ambrose, De. natal.
Dom. ser. 14, Wleatever pollueed character be present at the
festival, although he may be there in body, he is separated in
mind ; and whilst he would be ser-vz'ceable, he is really itgju-
rious.

Lastly‚ we must beware, lest we pervert holy days to
idleness, luxury, and base pleasures altogether unbecoming
Christians. For although in publicly observing sacred
rites, itis not unlawful to relax the mind, yet we must
take heed that that saying of Tertullian, in Apologet. be
not rightly applied to us; Is public rejoicing co be llius ex-
pressed by public disgrace? Do these things become solemn
days, which are unbecoming other days? shall liceuse in evil
be—piety ? Shall an occasion of luxury be accounted religion?
