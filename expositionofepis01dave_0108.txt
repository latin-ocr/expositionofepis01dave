22 AN EXPOSITION oF s'r. PAUL’S Chap. i.

dispenset· of spiritual gifts, imparts spiritual graces to those
wlzom lte belzolds beaving the sign of lzoly baptism. Peter
promises this to the baptised, Acts ii. 38, Be baptised every
one of you in tlze name of Christ, ANn YE SHALL REcmvss
THE GIFT OF THE Hom( Gnosr. And this is the first
reason why Paul calls baptised persons saints.

Secondly, they are called saints, because in baptism they
are in an especial manner dedicated to the service of God.
For in baptism a covenant is entered into with God. He
receives us under his protection3 we acknowledge him for
our Lord, and renounce all other lords, viz. the world, the
flesh, and the devil. We are therefore, as it were, certain
consecrated vessels, set apart from profane uses to the
sacred service of God. In this respect Nazianzen calls
baptism, tlze covenant qf' α more hely lise with God,· and
Peter, lEpis. iii. 21, the answer (επερωτημα) of a good con-
science towards God.

From the consideration of this characteristic many in-
ferences might be deduced ; we shall deduce three.

1. Whereas the Apostle calls not this or that good
man, but the Colossians promiscuously, saints, as many as
put on Christ by baptism; hence we learn, that we must
think and speak well of all who profess religion, unless by
clear and manifest deeds they shew themselves to be un-
godly and hypocrites. For the Apostles always, when
they descend to particular men or churches, presume every
Christian to be elect, sanctified, justified, and in the way
of being glorified‚ until he himself shall have proved him·
sels to be wicked or an apostate. So Paul writing to the
Corinthians affirms indiscriminately concerning them, Ye
are washed, γε are sanctffied, ve are justffied, 1 Cor. vi. 11.
For as in those things which relate to faith, we must speak
and think according to Soripture, which is a certain and
infallible rule : so, in other things which relate to charity,
it is sufficient to think and to speak according to the pro-
bability of appearances. This rule may deceive; yet not
by any fault or hazard of him who thought better of ano-
ther than he truly deserved, but rather of that hypocrite,
