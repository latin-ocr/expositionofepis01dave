ites heretofore said to Aaron, Malce us gods which shall go
before us, for assor this Moses we wot not what is become of
him; so say they, Let us make to ourselves some visible
head of the Church, for we know not what has become of
Christe* Moreover also, inasmueh as our Head is a man,
we infer two things,

l. On account of this allianoe of nature, he must of
necessity intimately love us, and have such a keen. sense of
our miseries, as to be most ready to succour us (Judg. x.
16). This the Apostle himself infers, Heb. ii. 17, 18,
Wherefore in all things it belzoved him to be made like unto lzz‘s

tinction—a Professor of Rhetoric, Histoi-y, and Philosophy in the Univer-
sities of Rome, Fermo, and Mace-rata, and, in the latter place Counsellor
of the Inquisition--being employed about the middle of the last century to
prove the Pope's supremacy, by shewing from century to century, that since
the Apostle's time to the present, it had ever been acknowledged by the
catholic Church, he soon found that he had undertaken more than it was
possible to persor-nu viz. on coming to the close of the second century.

“ time, it had been utterly unknown to the Christian world. In spite,
“ then, of my endeavours to the contrary, reason getting the better ofthe
“ strongest prejudices, 1 began to look upon the Pope’s Supremacy, not only
“ as a prerogative quite chimerical, but as the most impudent attempt that
‘⁶ had ever been made: Ι say, in spite of my endeavours to the contrary;
“ for 1 was very unwilling to give up a point, upon which 1 had been

“ great is the power of truth; and at last it prevailed: 1 became a proselyte
“ to the opinion which I had proposed to confute; and sincerely abjured,
“ in my mind, that which I had ignorantly undertaken to defend.''
