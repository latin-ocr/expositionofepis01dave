Ver. 11. EPlSTLE To THE cotossmss. 133

prayer. He entreated for them, in the first place, an in-
fused knowledge of the divine will ; secondly, fruitfnlness in
works of holiness: now, lasffly, he desires for them might,
from some special strengthening, because the cross awaits
all those who will live godly in Christ, 2 Tim. iii. 12.
Observe 3 Even after a knowledge of the truth is infused,
and the grace of holiness imparted, yet the regenerate re-
main infirm and weak to undertake any spiritual good, to
strive against vices, to resist temptations 3 unless they are
further strengthened and sustained. This Paul confesses,
Το will is present with me, bnt how to perform that which is
good I find not, Rom. vii. 18. This was manifested in
David and Peter, who, by reason of this infirmity of our

nature, fell 111 the day of temptation.
This infilmity of the regenerate and sanctified man, Pa-

risiensis illustrates by some beautiful similitudes in his
book of Temptations and the means of resisting them3 of
which it will not be foreign to our undertaking to adduce
a few, that it may be understood what wisdom the Apostle
evinced in desiring strengthening also for them after sanc-
&fication-

l. He compares the regenerate and sanctgfied man to a
lcnight splendz'slly armed, who proceeds to battle monnted upon
a prancing and refractory horse .· for he is often thrown by the
movements of his steed, unless some other person come to his as
sistance .· so the regenerate man, having z‘n himself a concupis-
cence resisting and fightiny against the Spirit, will ofttimes be
thrown to the earth, unless he be supported and strengthened
from another quarter-

2. He compares the regenerate and godly man to a haild-
ing, the npper part of which consists of firm and solid mate-
rials, the lower is dry and combustible: for so the renewed
man, as to his regenerated part, viz. his spirit, consists as it
were of endowments and graces that are divine, which possess
in themselves stability ,· but as to his inferior part, viz. the flesh,
he consists of lusts and evil inclinatiores : as therefore that
building, so the renewed man, being easily itfianzed in the irffe-
rior part, will be wholly destroyed, unless he be protected and
snccouredfronz some other quarter.
