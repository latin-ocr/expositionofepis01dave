understanding, to a contemplative life3 whereas both equal-
ly regard an active one.

Wisdom, then, is the infused knowledge of those things
which pertain to faith and a good life, with pious affections
inclining to the applicatiou and practice of the same.

For spiritual wisdom consists not of the illumination of
the intellect alone, neither of the renovation of the affec-
tions alone, but of both conjointly. Which may be
proved from many testimonies of Scripture: The sectr of
the Lord is wisdom ,· and to departfi'om evil is understanding,
Job xxviii. 28. Whoso keepech the law is a wise son, Prov.
xxviii. 7. From which and similar places, it is manifest,
that this wisdom, although as to its essence it is a certain
perfection of the intellect, yet as to its matter and use, is
also practical and moral. Wisdorn, therefore, is not only
the light of the soul, but a certain healthiness and perfec-
tion of it. The light of mere knowledge is sometimes
communicated to the wicked; sor many know the will of
God, but they do it not, nay, they plainly hate it: but the
light of wisdom always renders a man picus, because it at
once inclines the will to that good which is apprehended
by the intellect. Such wisdom Paul supplicates for the
Colossians.

As to what pertains to the understanding or intellect,
συνεσιν, Ι do not think it to be a gift in reality distinct from
the afore—mentioned wisdom; but to be a more eminent
degree3 and, as it were, the pinnacle of wisdom. It is,
therefore. a certain ripeness of wisdom, by which any one
is fitted to judge of truth and falsehood, good and evil,
when they are involved in some special difficulty, from par-
ticular circumstances. Hence the disciples of the Saviour
are said to be ὀισύνετοι, without zmderstamliig, Matth. xv. 16,
because they understood not the doctrine of Christ clothed
in parables. And Paul wished for Timothy, an understand-
ing in all things, ‘2 Tim. ii. 7.—But we shall render these
points more plain by adducing examples ς and first in
things to be believed, then in things to be done.

Let a question be proposed, thether the only Mediator
of God and men bc the nian Christ Jesus3 every one en—
