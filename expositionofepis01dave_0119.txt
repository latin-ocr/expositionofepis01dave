himself. For if by grace we understand the gratuitous
love of God towards us, this love flows immediately from
the Divine will, is not called forth by human merit: Hence
says God, J erem. xxxi. 3, I have loved thee with an eve1·last-

And most divinely does Bernard speak, in Cant. Serm. 59,
And God loveth : not that lze derives this from any other
