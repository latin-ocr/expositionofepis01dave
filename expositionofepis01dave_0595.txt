Apostle prudently advises, Rom. xii. 3, Let no one think more

Where an obscure matter οτι-θεάς our measure, and the holy
Scriptum does not clem-(y help ηε, human conjecture raslzly
presumes to determine anything. August. ad Optat. Epist.
157.

2. Concerning things relating to religion, nothing
should be determined without a sure foundation3 but that
foundation is the word of God; for whatever things we see
relating to our salvation we see in this. He who obtrudes
any thing which he did not find there, bath not seen it, but
ilnagined, asin a dream, that he hath seen it.

53. Our Church is not to be condemned because she
does not receive those dogmas about purgatory,indulgences,
the worship of saints, and other things of the same sort:
since (if we should allow, which, however, we cannot
allow, that they are not repugnant to the word of God,) it
is certain, neither the Fathers nor the Papists found any of
these in the Scriptores. And we are not bound to believe
men when they intrude upon us those things which they
have not seen.

4. They, therefore, exercise tyranny over the Church,
who pronounce as heretics, and anathematize, all who will
not hold those comments of men for articles of faith.

Thus far concerning the defect of certain knowledge in
these seducers.

Vainly pqffed up by leis fleshly mind] Here again the
Apostle reprehends the aforementioned doctrine3 because,
not only do the authors of it labour ignorantly, but, more-
over, are puffed up with pride, and thence presume that
their inventions are the dictates of tluth itself. For the
fleslzly mind denotes the reason of the animal 111an‚or per-
spicacity not enlightened by the Divine Spirit. Therefore‚
they iashly think that they can discover truth 1n the busi-
ness of religion by their own acuteness of understandino,
whereas the na 'mal man cannot ι’·εεείῑε the things which
