336 ΑΝ EXPOSITION or ετ. PAULS Clzap.ii'.

themselves, by declaring their order, their stedfastness in
the faith, and by importuning them to constancy and pro-
gress in these good qualities3 and, lastly, from the facts
themselves, by teaching that he strives for the treasures of
Christ, but his adversaries for dross instead of gold, i. e.
for doating schemes and impostures.

Although these technicalities are not immediately in
connexion with our undertaking, I was nevertheless desir-
ous to glauce at them by the way for two reasons. One
waS, lest we should despise the sacred Scriptures and their
writers as devoid of eloquence and human literature. For
that remark of Ambrose, Epist. lib. 8. ep. 63, is true:
The writers of tlze divine booles, although they did voc write
them according to the rules of art, but according to grace,
wlzicli z's superior to arc ,· yet they who lzave written coucerning
this art, have discovered tlze redes <ff ie in their writings. And
that also of Augustine, 4 De doctr. Christ. cap. 7, The scz-
cred writings possess, but do not effect eloquence. For God,
who hath formed the voice, the mind, and the tongue,
however he would have their discourses to be wanting in
disguise, was yet unwilling that they should be in any wise
deficient in useful and solid art. Vide Rupert, lib. 7, con-
cerning the works of the Holy spirit, as largely proving
this*

The other reason why we have just touched the skilful
disposition of the Apostle's writing was, lest unskilful and
unlearned men, when they write or preach whatever comes
uppermost‚ exhibiting no study or art, should flatter them-
selves, as though they trod in the steps of the Apostles·
They, being extraordinarily assisted by the inspiration of
the Holy Spirst, wanted not the ordinary aid of art3 but

⁵* Rupert, Abbot of Duyts or Deutch: he was born at Ypres, in Flan-
ders, in 1091, and died in 1135. He is commonly known and cited' as Ru-
pertus Tustiensis, and is one of the three famous Commentators of the
12th century noticed by Du Pin: but besides his Commentaries on parts of
the Bible, he wrote several other Theological Treatises, among which was
the one cited above. He was a learned and a pious man. But Bellarmin
and other late Roman writers disparage his works, because, forsooth, he
entertained opinions about the Eucharist differing from the novel Popish
doctrine of 'l'ransubstantiation.
