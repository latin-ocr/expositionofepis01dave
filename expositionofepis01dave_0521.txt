the Mosaic circumcision. The reason is drawn from the
excellence of our circumcision, which he shews first from
its Author: in Clzrist, i. 6. by Christ, or hythe efficacy and
virtue of Christ, ⁴qe are circumcised; in vain, therefore,
would ye receive the Mosaic circumcision. The force of
this argument is clear, if we recal what has been said by
the Apostle about Christ. For he has extolled Christ as
the only begotten of God, the Head of the Church‚ the
storehouse of grace, and, finally, as enriched with the ful-
ness of the Godhead itself: it would, therefore, tend to
bring reproach upon Christ, if any one being circumcised
by him, should desire to be circumcised by any one else3
for the desire of another indicates that there was some de-
fect in the circumcision of Christ himself. For as it would ·
be both injurious to himself and to his king, should any
one, being adorned with the dignity of a knight by the
king himself, desire to receive the same honour after ano-
ther manner by some inferior minister: so 116 who is cir·
cumcised by Christ, our King and Lord, proceeds to dimi-
nish his majesty, ifin this same thing he should desire the
ministry of another. Thus much concerning the Author:
I pass on to the manner.

With the circumcision made without Ιιαηᾶε, hy the circumci-
sion of ClzriSt.] I unite these, because both may be refer·
red to the manner of this circumcision which we have ob·-
tained in Christ, or by Christ. For it might be said, that
Christ circumcised no one. Nay, says the Apostle, we are
circumcised in him. But 111 what way? With the circum-
cision made without hands, i. e. not bodily and sensibly3 but
with the circumcision of Christ, i. 6. spiritually‚ inwardly,
and invisibly, such as it behoves us to expect from our
heavenly Priest. The mode* of this circumcision is de-
scribed then, 1. Negatively : It is not wroughtmanuallq, for
it is made without hands. By this he opposes the Mosaic
circumcision, which consisted in an external operation ad-
ministered by the hands of men. 2. It is also described
positively; since it is called the circmnczsion (ff Christ, i. e.
a certain internal circumcision effected by the power of the
Spirit of Christ himself. And by this it is far preferred to
