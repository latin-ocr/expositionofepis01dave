that Synod, and most aggrieved with the conclusions thereof,
concerning the points controverted‚ are, notwithstanding, as ve-
hement and resolute maintainers of Ministerial Parity, as any
that concluded or accepted the judgment of that Synod,

“ Moreover, in our private conversations with the most eminent
of the Ministry there, we found, divers times, upon occasion of
our declaring to them the order and manner of our Church Go-
vernment, that they were more ready to deplore than defend their
own condition: and wished, rather than hoped, to be made like
the Church of England. Nor were these, therefore, the less
ready to concur for the Dort conclusions, but were rather of the
principal and forward actors therein.

“ Secondly‚ In special, we plead against a supposed act of

subjected to their consideration and suffrages. And, for the surer
preventing opposition or dispute, the articles concerning disci-
