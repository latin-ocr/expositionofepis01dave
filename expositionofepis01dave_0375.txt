trial qf our patience ; Tractat. in Joau. 124. But now what
the Papists have been pleased to set forth in addition, viz.
that men may by indulgences be absolved from these tem*
poral punishments, which otherwise, by every rule of di-
vine justice, they ought to have been subjected to, is very
plainly refuted from the above cited passages. For the
Pontiff, by all the powers of his bulls, can neither defend
the true penitent from the death of children, nor from a
general pestilence‚ nor inflict any other chastisement than
such as is according to the good pleasure of God.

3. From that communion of saints, which is an article
of our Creed, they argue, that the satisfactory works of
the saints which were not immediately wanting for their

who is appointed treasurer of this fund.

I answer, They assume two false hypotheses3 one, of
the superabundance of the merits and sufferings of the

same mystical union with one Head, and with each other3
and not in the communication of satisfactions. And the
reason is evident‚ because to make satisfaction for another,
and to liberate him from the punishment which divinejus-
tice requireS, is a work of mediation, not of simple love.
The offices of charity are indeed common amongst all the
members of the same body; the offices of a Mediator can
be performed by no one member to another, but proceed
from the Head alone to all the other parts3 for he alone is
the Mediator between God ‘and men.

In the last place, to return from our digression, from this
passage of Paul which we are now considering, and which
was the occasion of my discussing this controversy, Ca-
jetan argues as fellows3 Holy men suffered with the very
view and intention of making satisfaction thereby for
