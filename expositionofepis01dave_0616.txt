5:30 AN EXPOSlTloN oF ST. PAUL'S Clcap. ii.

In this verse, therefore, which puts a conclusion to the
refutation, there are three things to be observed and ex—
plained, as to those rites prescribed by men:

1. We must observe the Apostle's concession: for he
concedes to them λόγον σοφίας. Which things have indeed cz
slzew of wz‘sdom.

2. Three pretences are to be noted, by which for the
most part human traditions are covered to wear the appear-
ance of wisdom: These are, will-worship, Immiliry, and
neglecting ff tlte body.

3. We may observe the censure of the Apostle, who,
notwithstanding these pretences so fair, accounts these
commandments of men for things of nought: vot in any
honour to llze satisfying of thefleslz.

Which things have indeed α shew (ff wisdom.] The Greek
word λὸγον, some translate reason, some slzew, and others
pretence; with little difference of sense. For the Apostle
means this: The aforesaid cominandtnents of men have a
shew‚ or external appearance of wisdom, they have not the
reality and truth. There is, then, in these words, a prolep-
sis, or anticipation, which, whilst it concedes to the
adversaries what they could allege iu pretence, at the same
time would have thern understand that it was of no value.
But when the Apostle says, these doctrines of men have a
sleew ofwisdom, he means, they have the appearance of
some excellent doctrine, rather brought from heaven than
excogitated by human counsel : for thus the word wisdom
is used by Paul, as Beza hath rightly observed.

l. And they have this shew or pretence, First, on the
part of the impostors. For these, for the most part, pre-
tend, that they do not bring forward any thingof their own
mind, but promulgate those things, being enlightened by
the Spirit of wisdom himself. Under this pretence, Mon-
tanus formerly vaunted his prophecies, and imposed upon
many: for thus Tertullian, De praescript. before he was a
Montanist himself, writes, leey assert that the Parae-lete
spalce more things to IlIonlamts than Christ delivered z‘n the
δωρεὴ and not only more, but even better ancl greater.
Those who are a little more modest, venture not to pre-
