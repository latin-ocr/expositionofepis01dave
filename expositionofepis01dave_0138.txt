is: unless, therefore, saith be blind, and the Holy spirit
excite to false persuasion‚ there will he the same certainty
in inspired hope as in faith. For inspired hope not only

comprehends that pleasing expectation of future good,
which lies in the will; but the undoubted assurance of ob-
taining those things which subsist in the realising and sels-

, appropriating act of the mind 3 so also saith ; as Parisien-
sis, De mor. cap. 3, rightly observes.

Finally, Iadd the confession of adversaries: of Catha-
rinus,²‘“ who in the Conncil of Trent, maintained that the
faithful have the assurance qs divine saith, as to their own grace

⁸⁵ Ambrose Catharinus, of Siena, a Dominican Friar3 a celebrated Di-
vine of the sixteenth century, who was one of the Theologians deputed to
the Council of Trent in 1545, where he displayed remarkable ability. He
is represented by Roman Cathol‘ic Biographers, as having, in that Council,
‘⁶ distinguished himself as much by the singularity of his opinions, as by
his profound learning.’' The fact seems to be, that along with his defence
of some peculiarities of Popery, he commented freely upon the distinctions
which the Romish Church draws between Divine saith, and the faith ofthe
Church; and in the various discussions in which he took a part, he proved
himself not-only an able Divine and Rhetorician, but he boldly maintained
and defended some scriptural truths alleged against Luther as heretical.
Vide Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent,—He was, however,
soon afterwards created Bishop of Minori, and from thence translated to the
Archbishopric of Conza in 1551 3 and died suddenly at Rome in 1553.

Since writing the above, the Trans-lator, as he had some difficulty at
coming to what appeared to him the truth relative to Catharinus, has been
pleased on finding that the Rev. Mr. Scott, in his survey of the Council of
Trent, vol. 2 of the “ Continuation of Milner’s Church History‚'’ eor-
roborates the view he had taken. Page 272, he observes ς “ On the nature
of justification knowing how much the Church of Rome confounds it with
sanctification--making it to include an infused habit of grace, and not
simply to be acceptance to the favour of God--we are surprised and grati-
fied to find some leading characters openly asserting the forensic sense of
this term.’' Then p. 276 : “ On Free-will, Catharinus maintained, that
without God’s special assistance¹ man cannot do what is morally good ;'’ p.
279, “ We may add, that Catharinus avowed the same sentiment which
was adopted by our own Milton (viz. with respect to election), and by Dr.
John Edwards-’⁹

No wonder he should have been represented by his Biographers as “ main-
taining singular opinions ;'‘ or that F. Paul, the faithful historiari of the
Council of Trent, who disclosed all its secrets, should have been pronounced
by such writers, ‘⁶ a Calvinz’st in a Friar’s f1·ock!”
