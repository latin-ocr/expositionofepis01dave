defenders of the Papacy themselves, that the Pope may
become an heretic, and in such case ought to be deposed.

Secondly, he is not the universal Pastor of the Church,
who, by virtue of his ordination, is bound to his own
particular See: but the Roman ffishop, like any other, is
bound down to his See, and to his Chui·ch of Rome; or,
if he hath any more extended prerogative‚ he bath it by
human, not by Divine right. And yet it is not of men,
but of God alone to confer apostolic authority. So Cy-
prian: No one osus appoints himself a Bishop of bislzops.
Be lte whom you will, he lias bnt the free control over his own
jarisdiction. Afterwards he subjoins that the authority of

tle; for Gregory was remarkable for his earnestness in exalting his See. ⁴
Hence it has heenjustly remarked, that ‘⁶ there is no word in all the writ-
ings of Gregory wherein he more proudly boasts of the greatness of his Su-
premacy, than where he says, that he knew no Bishop who was not subject
to the See Apostolic.'' Nay, this very letter is filled with assumptions of
the same lofty kind 3 as where he asserts, that ⁴⁴ to St. Peter was given the
care and principality of the whole Church ;” and that “ the title of Uni-
versal Bishop was offered to the Bishop of Rome, by the Council of Chal-
cedon, and refused ;'' which appears to be altogether untrue. It is evident,
however, that although pride and ambition were beginning to work in the
Church on either hand, the grand principle on which all is built that has
since brought the Church of Rome into such melancholy distinction was
not, up to this period, admitted3 for Gregory, in arguing with John of
Constantinople against his adoption of the obnoxious title--OEcumenicus‚
or Unive1·sal--urges, that it was never given to St. Peter; none of the
Bishops of Rome had ever assumed it; it was contrary to the Canons, to
the Decrees of the Fathers, and an affront to Almighty God himself.‘’
But, in fact, through the letter, whilst he quarrels with the usurpation of
the Name by his rival prelate, Gregory unreservedly claims the lez'ng both
for himselt'and his See; to secure which he did not scruple to stoop to base flat-
tery of the bloody usurper Phocas. Mr. Blanco White, in his interesting
“Practical Evidences against Catholicism,” imputes to Gregory that neglect of
ancient literature, and the substitution of scholastic learning, by which the
corruptions of Popery and the religioiis darkness of the world were fostered3
and gives some extraordinary instances of his illiterateness; and it is the tes-
timony of Ridley concerning Gregory, in his treatise against the errors of
'l'ransubstantiafflom that “ in his days both corruption of doctrine and ty-
rannical usurpation did chiefly grow.” He was the inventor of the magni-
ficent and pompous ceremonies attending the celebration of the Mass, if not
of the Mass itself. The Translator cannot avoid adducing here the existing
evidence of a fact communicated to him by a friend, who, on visiting Rome
