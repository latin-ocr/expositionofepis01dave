(as they call it), sayS, the system of indulgences is no where
secfortlz in Scripture. And further, neither Gratiani? him-
self, nor the master of the sentences. makes any mention
of these empty bulls of the Roman Pontiffs.

Lasssy, the Schoolmen themselves cannot agree as to
the intrinsic value of indulgences ς wherefore almost all of
them advise those who have procured them, to fulfil all the
prescribed penances notwithstanding! And they further-
more add, that to render thern effectual there must be a

reprehended by the Protestant writers. ,The time and place of Mazolini's
death are equally unknown ; but it is asserted his morals were very relaxed.
He was the author of 47 works in Latin, or in Italian, on theology, philo-
sophy, and mathematics: these have long since fallen into oblivion. One
of the most popular (for it passed through several editions in the lssth cen-
tury) was his Summa Silvestrina, seu Summa de Peccatis aut Casuum Con-'
scientiae, vel Summa Summarum: B‹)logna‚11515, 2 vols. cito. This, most
probably, is the work cited by Davenant. With respect to the admission
made by the author as adduced above, Craig, in his ‘⁵ Refutation of Po-
pery‚'' has given it with an amplitude which the Translator cannot withhold
from his Readers. He introduces it thus: ‘⁶ Sylvester Prierias, in his con-
troversy with Luther, says, That indulgences have not been made known
to us by the authority of the Scriptum, but by the authority of the Roman
Church, and of the Roman Pontiffs, which is greater. Indulgentiae auc-
toritate Romanae Ecclesiae, Romanorumque Pontificum quae est major.
Thereby constituting the authority of the Pope superior to that of revealed
Scripture. As his partisans have elevated his personal authority in the
Church, far above the authority ofrevealed Scripture, this has a direct ten-
dency to render Christianity, like Mahometanism, a system of human in-
stitution—an invention of man.''—Our Expositor might have added farther,
in confirmation of the position in his last Section, an admission of Aquinas,
Sum. part. l. Qu. l. art. 8 et 10, ‘⁴ Our faith is founded upon revelations
made by prophets and apostleS. The church has instituted nothing except
such things as are not essentially necessary to salvation.”

³² Gratian :-a Benedictine Monk of Bononia, in Italy, of the l2th cen-
tury, was a native of Chiusi, and was the author of the first portion of the
“ Decretals,‘’ οι· “ Concordantia discordantium Canonum;” in which he
attempts to reconcile those Canonswhich seem to contradict each other.
One mode of doing this was by maintaining the dogma of Infallibility. The
following is his doctrine on the subject, Cap. 6. dist. 40, “ Si papa infinitas
animas secum in infernum traherit, tamen nemo dedit ei dicere, quid facis Ρ
'l'hough the Pope should draw with him innumerable souis to hell, yet no
man ought to say to him, What doest thou ?'' Gratian was, however,
guilty of some errors, which Anthony Augustine endeavoured to correct in
his work entitled “ De emendatione Gratian.'’ Gratian's Decretal forms
the first part of the Canon law.
