452 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’s Chap. ii

been said) it signifies that natural depravity which adheres
to all the children of Adam from their mother’s womb.
Neither is this signification of the word unusual. Thus it
is said in Deut. x. 16, Circumcise theforeslcin <ff your heare.
But more plainly in Jerem. ix. 25, Behold the days come that
I will punish all them which are circumcised ‘wz'tlz tlze micir-
cumcised, i. e. every one who, though outwardly circumcised,
yet bears within him the native depravity of the beart.

Retaining, then, this signification of the word, we say
that every natural man is dead in this his native corruption3
as well because no part of the soul can exercise any vital
action in spiritual things, as because, on account of this
corrupt nature, it is subject to Divine wrath and the punish-
ment of eternal death.

l. The understanding, which is the eye of the solil, is
darkened and wholly blinded as to spiritual things3 the ηα-
tura] man receivech not tlze things of tlze Spirit of God, nei-
ther can lze lmow them, 1 Cor. ii. 14. But another evil also
arises out of this darkness: For the mind which cannot
receive spiritual things 011 account of this darkness, rushes
also headlong into vain speculations, into errors, heresies,
and finally into innumerable deceivings. Hence heresies
are reckoned among the fruits of the flesh, Gal. v. 20. In
this condition, then, of corrupt nature, the understanding
lies dead ; deprived of its spiritual and salutary light3 cor-
roded‚ moreover, by vanity and error, as though it were
preyed upon by worms.

2. The will also is most sadly depraved; so that it has
lost all the desire of a good man, and burns with the con-
stant thirst for vain, nay, fo·- unlawful things. Hence that
complaint of God, Gen. vi. 5, Every imagination of the
thoughts ofman’s hear-t is only evil continually; and of David,
repeated by the Apostle, Rom. iii. leere is none righteous, ηο
not one: there is none that seelcech after God. They are all
gone out os tlte way, they are together become uuprofitable.

3. The inferior powers of the soul are disordered, so
that they refuse to obey the mind, nay, endeavour to go-
vern it: Isee (ι law in my member-s warring against the law of
my mind, Rom. vii. 23. Hence all the affections follow not
