Ver. 2. ErisrLss To ’run COLOSSIANs. 345

In this verse the argument is drawn from the triple fruit
of true and Evangelical doctrine. The Apostle contends
that they should persist in it; and that it is expedient for
them to persist in it. Why? First, that their hearts might
be comforted3 This is the first fruit. Second1y‚ that they
might be lenit together, and, as it were, cemented in love,-
this is the second fruit. Thirdly, that they might accain a
more enlarged, more certain, and more evident assurance of
understanding: and here he finally declares, by apposition,
what understanding or knowledge he means3 not that of
worldly things, but of God the Father and qf Christ.

Thac their hear-ts might be comforted] These words may
be referred to the Apostle’s conflict for the Colossians, and
his earnest persuasions to perseverance in the received
doctrine3 for from this conflict for them they might re-
ceive twofold comfort.

l. Since they saw from it that they were highly regard-
ed, and greatly beloved by the Apostle. For it is the
greatest consolation to men in danger to perceive that
others care for thern, especially those who are able to assist
them3 which the original word itself shews, for παρακαλειν
is to excite the mind of a person in difficulty by encourag-
ing him, or applauding3 as in single combat, or battles,
men encourage by their shouts those friends whom they
wish should conquer. Thus does the Apostle comfort the
Colossians, contending with their seducers, by his good
wishes, his advice, his encouragement‚ and his instruc-
tion.

2. They were comforted by this conflict of the Apostle,
since they clearly saw from it that the doctrine they had
drawn from Epaphras was approved by the Apostle, and its
reverse rejected and condemned. For, as Epaphras was
not one of the Apostles, they might entertain some doubt
respecting the certainty of doctrine delivered by him; es-
pecially when many were introducing new doctrines with
great appearance of wisdom. This scruple is therefore
removed from their hearts3 for the Apostle, directly taught
of the Holy Spirit, confirms the same doctrine by his suf-
frage, and contends for retaining it.
