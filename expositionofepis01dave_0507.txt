Ver. 9. EPlSTLE To THE cctossmns. 421

3. Itis objected; If the human nature of Christ be
hypostatically united to the Divine, then each is united
with the other entirely3 because it is without parts : but if
this be granted it follows, that wherever the Divine nature
is, there is also the human 3 and so we pass into the camp
of the Ubiquitarians.

We answer3 the consequence is denied3 because it is a
personal union with the properties of both natures preser-
ved. Since, therefore, it is a property of the human na-
ture to be circumscribed by certain limits3 it loses not this
property by virtue of this union to the infinite nature. For
as the natures united are not analogous, they are not made
so by the personal union3 since the union onlyjoins toge-
ther, but does not change the natures. Since, therefore,
the finite nature and the infinite are not analogous‚ the
Divine is not circumscribed by this personal union, nor the
human extended to the infinite. We, therefore, confess,
that the human nature is inseparably and indivisibly united
to the Divine, and that the Divine is in no place separated
from the human: not that the hunianity is in all places
where the Divinity is, by local position ; but that by a real
and hypostatical union it is joined to the Divinity wherever
existing. The union‚ or conjunction, is circumscribed by
no distance of place, because it consists in this, that the
Deity sustains the humanity as its own and peculiar pro-

und perfect Clarist5 and both natm-es, ‘37⁴' which 7ae consists, romain in their pro-
per-ties unclzangeable.''—WVe may well unite, in the words of Bower, who gives
us this Specimen of the Theology of the early part of the Church‚ in his
life of Gelasius, “ He must be quite blind, who does not see that the whole
strength of the Pope's argument rests upon this, That the bread and wine
in the Eucharist retain the nature and substance of the bread and wine,
notwithstanding their sacramental union with the body and blood of Christ.
This he does not prove, but supposes as a truth, not questioned either by
the Eutychiana? or the Catholics, and from thence argues the human nature
in Christ, to retain, in the same manner, its own substance, though united
with the Divinity. Should we suppose the bread and wine in the Euchar-
ist to be changed into the body and blood of Christ, this argument had been
of no force against the Eutyclcians, but might have been by them unanswer-
ably retorted against the Catholics.'‘ See also 'l'he History of 'ri-ausub-
stantiation by Bishop Cosins, 1657, in which Treatise the above passage
from Gelasius is addueed in Cap. 5. T tiis fact has given much exercise to
thc Jesuitic screw of Roman criticism.
