416 AN EXPOSlTlON oF ετ. PAUL'S Chap.ii.

ing? In this place, then, to dwell bodily, is nothing else
than to join to himself personalhs.

Neither should it seem a strange interpretation, when we
explain this word σωματικαῖς, υποςτατικαῗς, hoclt'ly, persomzlly:
for as the Hebrews put souls for persons (Gen. xiv. 21,
Give me the souls, and take the goods to tbyself; Acts vii. 14,-
Jacob with three scere andjlfleen souls went down into Egypt.
And Ezek. xviii. ⁶20, lee soul which sinnetlc it shall clie; i. e.
the person) so, among the Greeks, σῶμα signifies person.
Thucydides, lib. l, says, many poor persons are more ready
σωμασιν n χρημασι πολεμῶν, i. e. to go to war in their own per-
sons, (as they say) than to contribute momeyfor tlze war. So
Demosthenes said, σωμάταῗν και χρημάτων πλῆθος, abundance of
bodies, i. e. of men, or person& was on tlte side of tlte Athe-
nians, when he wished to excite them to war. And so this
word is used in the well-known epigram,

Σωματα πολλοὶ τρέφειν, καὶ &naara ’πολλ’ ἀνεγείρειν, &Q to nou-
rislz many bodies, and raz'se up many lzouses, &Q

The Apostle, therefore, when he says that the Godhead
dwells in Christ bodily, means, that the eterna] Son of God
united the human nature to himself, so that the person of
the Word, which subsisted in the Divine nature alone, now
also subsists in the human nature, and imparts personality
to it, which the human nature possessed not iii itself.
There are not, therefore, two persons in Christ, one of
man, and the other of the Son of G0d; but the Divine
nature is so united to the human, that it subsists in it
σωματικαῖς, i. e. σεσαρκόμενως καὶ ὑποςτατικω’“ς, incarnate and per—
sonally. Hence the sacred Scriptures call the Son of Mary
the Son os tlze Highest, Luke i. 323 and it is affirmed, verse
35, tlmt Holy llzing which was barn of Mary, was {lle Son of
God. On account of this personal union, ‘the Branch (gf
David is called Jelzovah, Jerem. xxiii. 5, 63 and tlte blessed
God, Rom. ix. 5. Hence Hugo de St. Victor, Erud. theol.
de Verb. incarn. collat. 2, says, lee Son of Gocl did not take
the person nean, but toosc man into tlte person. The persona}
XVord assumed man3 not a person, but the nature. Itis
said he assumed man, because a human soul and body were
assumed. lt is not said that he assumed the person of man
