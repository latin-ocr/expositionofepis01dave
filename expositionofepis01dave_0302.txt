216 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ST. PAUL's Chap. i.

Thus the Apostle teaches, Ephes. v. 22, 523, Wives submit
yourselves mito your own husbands as wito the Lord; for the
husband is the head qf the wffe, even as Christ is the head of
the Church: Thercjfore the Church is subject vnto Christ, &c.

3. In way of causality or influence. For the head im-
parts and communicates sense and motion to 311 its mem-
bers: the members are devoid of all motion and sense if
separated from the head: So Christ sends forth spiritual
life and the motion of grace into his members which are
otherwise insensible, dead, and destitute of all spiritual
motion. Wz'tlzout me με can do nothing, ⁴John xv. 5 ; but, on
the other hand, l can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me, Phil. iv. 13.

Therefore the appellation of head is most fitly applied to
Christ, in respect of all those particulars in which the head
must differ and be distinguished from all the members.
Now, then, let us consider those things in which the agree-
ment of the head and the members is perceived: And these
are three :

1. The natural head bath a natural conformity with the
rest of the members : for as the Poet hath rightly said, it
would be monstrous and ridiculous‚

If α pointel· slzouldform α design (ff unicing α horse's neck
to α haman lzeadfi‘*

Thus monstrous would it be, if the head of the Church
had not a natural conformity with the Church. But Christ
hath this, as is shewn, Heb. ii. He took not on him the ηα-
ture of angds, hut he took on him the seed (ff Abraham. For-
asmuch as the children are par-calcem ‹ffflesh and blood, he also
himself likewz'se look part (gf the same.

2. The head and the members have a conformityin their
destination to the same end, viz. the preservation and
safety of the whole person z thus Christ, and the members
of Christ, which are one person, are ordained to the at-
tainment of one end, viz. eternal glory and happiness3 and
to the accomplishment of this end both head and members
assiduously co-operate. This is the care of the head, to
