things which are false.

4. Because to attribute to rnen what is the peculial·
right of God, is great impiety: but absolute ‹lominion
over our bodies and our minds, is the property of God
alone. The human will owes absolute obedience to him3
the understanding owes to him prompt assent in all things :
but to yield to any mortal such subjection of the will, and

very well explains the reason of this, Quaest. disp. de
consens. art. 5. Every one, says he, is bound to examine his
own actions according to tlte knowledge he llas from God, wlle-
tlter it be natural, or acquhed, 01· itgfased; for every man
ought to act according to reason. Thus speaks Aquinas.
This is confirmed by the example of all the pious3 who,
although they arrogated not to themselves a judgment of
authority over their prelates or magistrates, yet they used
ajudgment of discretiori about the things proposed to
