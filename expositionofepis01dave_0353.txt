to God. But to what purpose are these things? That ye
may understand that that wholesome doctrine which God
would have to be preached through the whole world, is un-
justly withheld from Christian people.

Lastly. When the Apostle directs us to continue in the
Gospel which was preached by the Apostles in all the
world, he delivers to us the rule of the true and catholic
saith, viz. the apostolical preaching, which we now have
committed to us in writing. If we can shew the doctrine
of our Church to correspond with this, we are Catholics,
although we dissent not only from the church of Rome,
but from many other churches. For we ought to continue
firm and grounded in that saith which was from the first
preached to every creature, not in novel dogmas which af·-
terwards crept into the Church. Rightly and wisely said
Gerson, De vit. Spirit. par. 3, The doctrines of the Apostles
are of another authority than those of their suceessors; even
as the authority of the primitive Church was greater than that
of the present. lt is not, therefore, in the power of the Pope,
or of couneils, to change the doctrines delivered to us by the
Apostles: nor have they equal authority with respect to this
point, viz. to malce any thing to be clearly an article ofsaith.
Thus testifies Gerson. But Paul himself speaks much
more pointedly, Is we, or an angel from heaven, should
preach any other Gospel zttzto you, than tlmt we have preached‚
let him be ocem-sed, Gal. i. 8. Since, therefore, our cliurch
acknowledges and receives the apostolic doctrine heretofore
preached in all the world, let us not regard the railings of
Romanists, who call us heretics and schismastics because
we continue not stedfast in certain papistical errors.

Thus much concerning the second reason why we should
continue in the doctrine of the Gospel.

Whereof' I, Paul, ani ma‘de a minister] This is the last
argument for continuance in the doctrine received. For in
these words it is shewn, that the Gospel preached to the
Colossians by Epaphras, was the same with that which was
every where disseminated by Paul himself. Moreover,
Paul, although he was personally unknown to the Colos-
