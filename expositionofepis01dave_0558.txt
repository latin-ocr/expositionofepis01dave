that Christ was to suffer, were saved from hell and the
devil by the virtue and merit of his death, like as we also
are who now believe Christ to have suffered. They looked,
therefore, after this life, not for limbus, but for that city
which huth foundations, Heb. xi. 10, αη heavenly country,
ver. 16, even already prepared Jbr them.

Although Christ himself died in the fulness of time, yet
he first became a Surety to his Father that he would die for
the deliverance of the human race: therefore, this security
being accepted of the Father, there was no impediment why
the patriarchs‚ being freed from their debts, should not be
put in possession of salvation, before the price itself was
actually paid. For if among rnen, culprits and debtors are
accustomed to be liberated upon just satisfaction being
made, why should we not think God the Father to have
done the same of his goodness? Not any reason, there·
fore, obliges us to determine that the patriarchs were shut
up in the prison of limbus, and were brought out and deli-
vered a long time after upon the coming of Christ.

Moreover‚ although the fathers speak doubtfully con-
cerning this thing, yet testimonies are not wanting from
among them whereby this papistical limbus may be over-
turned. Tertullian, advers. Marcion, 4, cap. 34, says3
The mouth of hell z's one thing, the bosom os Abraham another,
And a little after3 There is α temporary receptacle for the
souls (ff the faithful, where they have aforetaste of happiness
till the resurrection. This father differs from the Papists in
two things3 l. Because, although he does not think the bo-
som of Abraham to be the celestia] place, yet he thinks it
to be elevated far above hell: 2. Because he thinks the
souls of the pious to be preserved there till the resurrec-
tion; whereas the Papists acknowledge their limbus to be
long since spoiled.* Augusfflne, in lib. quaest. super Genes.

“ The inquisitive reader may find the opinions of Tertullian on this sub·
ject, and the other notions here adverted to, more fully stated in Bishop
Kaye’s interesting “ Ecclesiastical History illustrated from Tertullian.'‘

in Archbishop Ushcr's answer to the Jesuit.
