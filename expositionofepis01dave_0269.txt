Ver. 15. EPISTLE To THE cotossmns. 183

Secondly, Since God is invisible to us in this life, and
yet our happiness consists in seeing him3 vve ought to sigh
for that other life : and vve ought so to frame ou'r life that
we may at length attain to the beatifie vision of the invisi-
ble Go‘d. It behoves us, therefore, to guard our heart
against all defilement: Rlessed are the pure in heart‚s0r they

tains “ that the images of Christ, and the mother of God, are to be had and
retained, and that due honour and worship is to be given to them.'' It was
the grossness of this constant practice of image worship-“ the reverential
bowIngs and bendings of the knee, and prostrations practised before the
images and relies in the public worship os the church of Rome,'' says the
Rev. James Smith, “ that first led me to the suspicions I conceived of the
erroneousness of the church of Rome, as contrary to the express words of
the Second Commandmentss' This took place whilst he was a student' in
the Romish College at Ι isbon, and eventually led to his separation from the
church of Rome, t>and becoming aClergyman of the church of England.

His volume on ‘ the F r1 ors of the Church of Rom& is a publication well
worth attention, containing a fund of information on the subjecta at issue
between us and them. This is what constitutes Protestantism. Papists
are wont to assail Protestantism as a new Religion, and to brand us as he-
retics; whereas true Protestantism is a return to the true, and ancient, and
orthodox faith-“ the saith once delivered to the saints,'' and from which
THEY have swerved. They are fond of reverting, as it respects usin
England, to Henry the Eighth's time. But the case is parallel to the one
just adverted to; only differing as to magnitude and numbers. As Sharon
Turner in his hIodern History, vol. i. p. 573, has well observed: “ All
‘⁶ Henry's Court, and Parliament, and Nation, were born and educated in
‘⁴ the Romish faith, and all they did was therefore the act of Catholics. A
“ different state of things began in Edward VI. and Elizabeth’s time. They
“ were trained up to Protestant principles ; and so were the children ofmost
“ of the suhjects of Henry VIII. The acts of these were therefore those
“ of Protestants. If any of the preceding Catholics threw off opinions and
⁴⁸ habits, which they thought wrong, they were still Catholics who so act-
“ ed, and their decisions were the decis‘mns of Catholics discerning what
“ was erroneous, and preferring what their reason and conscience perceived
“ to be preferable. Their children being educated as Protestants, acted on
‘⁶ different principlesz they judged as Protestants, as their fathers had
“ judged as Catholies. This distinction is important· The change of Ca-
“ tholics into the new opinions, was the verdict of Catholics in their fa-
a< νοω-ς who met them with a Catholic mind, and examined them with
“ Catholic prepossessions. The English Reformation was thus the wise and
“ good work of the Catholics themselves, correcting the abuses oftheir own
‘⁶ church, and establishing a purer system of Catholic Christianity. Pro-
“ testantism is Catholic Christianity reformed from its papal corruptions.
“ Romanism is sectarianism, compared with Apostolical Christianity.‘’
