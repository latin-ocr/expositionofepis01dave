Ver. 4. EPISTLE To THE comssmns. 71

every one, so far as he understands that he can be a par-
taker of the divine fruition‚ is bound to love himself, and
to desire that divine good to himself which is the proper
subjectos love.

Nay, we may moreover add, that no one is able to love
God ti‘uly,³‘t who at the same time does not truly love him-
self: for he who loves God, wishes to enjoy the divine bles-
sedness3 but to wish this good to himself is to love him-
self truly. Furthermore, every one wishes the enjoyment
of God to himself first, aud more intensely than to ano-

one had rather it should be communicated to himself by
God than to another. And the reason is, because more
causes concur to make him in this mannerlove himself
rather than another. For another may fall from this divine*
good without my loss οι· fault, but I myself cannot.

But it may be asked, if every one is bound to love him-
self, and that more intently than another with this kind of
love, why is there no express and direct precept concern-

loves God wishes to enjoy God, desires to be united to
G0d; he. wishes therefore the chief and greatest good to
himself, and hence he loves himself as much as possible.
Also, it may be replied, that the written law was given in
aid of the law of nature, which was obscured through sin;
yet was not so obscured, but that it might move any one
to love himself: therefore an express command concerning
the love of oneself was not'necessary. But as to what is
said that the love of oneself is condemned in Scripture, it
must be understood concerning an inordinate love which
respects sensible good, not of that kind of love which has
respect to divine good. For no one can too much love, or
