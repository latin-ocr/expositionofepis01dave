Ver. 10. EPlS'rLE To THE conossrANS. 423

Verse 10.

And με arecomplece 2:22 ln'm, wll-ich is the head of all princi-
pality and power.

That we must adhere to Christ and his doctrine alone, is
concluded in the foregoing verse from the infinite perfec-
tion of Christ3 which neither requires nor admits any ad-
ditions of philosophy, or traditions‚ or ceremonies. The
Apostle now shews that same thing by two other argu-
ments.

The first is drawn from the effect3 Ye are complete, or
consummate, or pelfect in lu'm; i. e. Christ himself is not
only perfect in himself, inasmuch as in him dwells all tlzeful-
uess (ff the Godlzead; but he brings it to pass that we are
complete through him, namely, having all things in him,
and his doctrine, which are necessary to our salvation:
Therefore it is not needful to seek salvation apart from
Christ and the Gospel.

The second is taken from the office of Christ. Christ is
Ibe lzead, not only of men, but of angels also3 by him,
therefore, both men and angels have their perfectiori. Men
ought not to seek or expect salvation from angeIS, but both
should depend upon Christ, who is the head of both. Now
let us examine these reasons separately.

Amltye are complete in leina] Two things are here to be
noticed: 1. What it is to be complete, or in what things
our completeness, consummation, or perfection consist.
2. How this perfection maytbe obtained or held by us3
which the Apostle intimates when he says, in him.

As to the first3 To be complete is nothing else than to be
furnished with all things necessary to salvation: which we
may severally refer to these three heads3 1. perfect wis-
dom, or saving knowledge : 2. righteousness: 3. sanctifi-
cation: possessing which things in this life, happiness and
· glor-y will follow in the lise to conie.
