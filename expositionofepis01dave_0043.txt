own infirmities than others, being humble, and therefore charit-
able.'' Upon no occasion does he appear to have forgotten coN-
sxs'rENCY. Being once summoned to attend the King at Newmar-
ket, he refused to travel on the Lord's-day; and upon arriving a
day later than required, he assigned the simple cause; and James,
much to his credit, gave him a cordial welcome, not only accept-
ing his excuse, but also commending his seasonable forbear-
auce.

In the intervals of episcopal duty, Davenant turned his atten-
tion to the revision and publication of his different writings. His
Expositio Epistolae D. Paula· ad Colossenses, had been ‘delivered
in a series of Lectures to the Students at Cambridge, as Lacly
Margaret’s Professor. This, as it is his most valuable work, so was
it the first he issued. It was published at Cambridge in 1627, re-
published in 1630, and went into a third edition in 1639; each
edition being in small folio. There is also a quarto edition, print- ¹
ed at Amsterdam in 1646. The character of this book has been
happily expressed by a popular writer in the following ternis :
“ For perspicuity of style and accuracy of method3 for judgment
in discerning and fidelity in representing the Apostle's meaning3
for strength of argument in resuting errors, and felicity of inven-
tion in deducing practical doctrines, tending both to the establish-
ment of saith, and the cultivation of holiness, it is inferior to no
writing ofthe l<ind; and richly deserves to be read, to be studied,
to be imitated, by our young divines.’'* We may also subjoin the
testimony of an invaluable living writer, who in a letter to the
translator, observes, ‘⁶ I know no exposition upon a detached
portion of Scripture (with, perhaps, the single exception of Owen
on the Hebrews) that will compare with it in all points. Leighton
is superior in sweetness, but far inferior in depth, accuracy, and
discursiveness.'‘† Nor can we avoid adverting to an anonymous
testimony, if it were only to illustrate the utility of occasionally
annexing notices in the front of valuable and rare books. A copy
was received some time since by a Clergyman, (the Rev. J.
Garbett‚ Rector of St. George’s, Birmingham,) from one of his
Parishioners, who having bought it with a lot of other old vo-

invaluable practical book that has ever yet been publi-:hed on this weighty
subject3 and which, next to his Bible and Prayer Book, should be the
study and application of every divine of the Chul-ch of England.
