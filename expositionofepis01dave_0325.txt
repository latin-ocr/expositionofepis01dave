Ver. 20. EPISTLE To THE conossmNs. 239

tures are wont to say, that we are reconciled to the father.
It is the property of the Son, as Mediator, to intercede,
and fully to pay λύτρον, the ransom-price of reconciliation :
hence they say that we are reconciled bys the Son. It is the
property of the spirit to set the seal to this confidence of
reconciliation in our hearts. We are reconciled, therefore,
to the Father‚ and we are reconciled also to the Son and to
the Holy spirit, inasmuch as they are one God in three
Persons.

But here it is objected: If Christ reconciles us to the
whole Trinity‚ then he reconciles usto himself: but no one
is called a Mediator in regard to himself, but with refer-

I answer, The Son must be viewed in a twofold light:
In one with reference to the Divine essence and nature, in ’
regard to which he also is offended : in the other with re-
ference to the Divine cconomy, whereby this Person, al-
though offended, was willing to take human flesh‚ and, by
a voluntary engagement, to be the medium of reconcilia·
tion between God and men. The same Christ, therefore,
received the sacrifice of reconciliation, as God offended in
his nature; but he offered it as Mediator, the God-man, in
the Divine economy, or voluntary dispensation of grace.—
This is the opinion of Junius.

had before called the image of God, the first-born of every
creature, tlte head of the Clean-ch, endowed with all tkefalness
of grace ,· by Christ Jesus, the incarnate Son of God.
leere is none other name under heaven wlzereby we can hope to
be saved, Acts iv. 12. No creature either could or ought to
reconcile us to God3 not an angel3 nor a mere man3 but
Christ the Θεανθρωπος-ὼθ Son of God. An angel could
not reconcile us, because the rule of Divine justice re-
quired, that satisfaction should be given by the same na-
ture that had sinned and was to be delivered. Neither‚ in-
deed, was it fit that man should owe his salvation and re-
