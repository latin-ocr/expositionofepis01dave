Ver. 27. EPlS'rLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 309

2. He distinguishes this inystery of salvation, as he
proceeds, with new encomiums, viz. riclzes and glory.

3. He states specifically what are the riches and what
is the glory of this saving mystery3 namely, Christ himself
dwelling in us by faith.

As for the first3 the Apostle adds the reason of this di-
vine dispensation, for the purpose of answering an implied
objection. For it might be asked, If this doctrine of the
Gospel be the doctrine of salvation, why was it not made
known to the world during so many ages? Why even now
is it made known effectually only to the elect and to those
who are sanctified by the Spirit? The Apostle gives no
other reason for this distinction than the will of God : This
mystery was made manifest to those to whom God was pleased
to make it known. The same will of God, therefore, is the
cause both of that concealment, by which the Gospel was
hidden from the ages gone by; and of that revelation by
which it is now made manifest to his saints.

Some persons fondly pretend, that that barbarous age
was not fit to receive such mysteries3 but that in this its
more matured period, the world became wiser, and more
capable of receiving the doctrine of salvation. But this
supposition is grounded on a false hypothesis3 for the grace
of God does notfind, but make men fit for receiving grace.
Others again imagine, that God in mercy refrained from
revealing the doctrine of salvation to those ancient times,
because he foreknew that they would reject it. But this
reasoning also is refutcd by experience 3 for the foreknow-
ledge of human pride and infidelity does not stop the pro-
mulgation of the Gospel. Nay more, God suffers it to be
preached expressly to many to whom it is tlte savour ofdeatli
anto death, 2 Cor. ii. 16. So that it is useless to seek for,
or to give any reason why the mystery of salvation was so
long hidden from so many nations‚ and why it was after-
wards revealed, beyond that of God's will, leo in times
past suffered all nations to walle in their own wczyS, Acts xiv.
16. Hence then let us learn,

is a part of Divine Providence to provide for every man
