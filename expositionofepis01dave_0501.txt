Father, must also be understood of the Holy spirit. It
would be easy to shew this from the Scriptures. For the
Word alone is said to be madefleslz‚ i. e. to be incarnate,
John i„ Yet the work of incarnation is ascribed to the
whole Trinity: to the Father‚ who is said to have prepared
this his salvation, Luke ii. 31, and Heb. x. 5: to the Son
himself, who is said to have taken the seed of Abraham,
Heb. ii. 16: and, lastly, to the Holy Spirit, who in the
conception of Christ, is said to have ovet-sleadowed the Vir-
gz'n, Luke i. 35. Thus far concerning the dwelling, viz. the
human nature of Christ3 and the inhabitant, viz. the [οε-μς,
or the Son of God ε Now let us enquire about the mode of

By bodily, therefore, we ought to understand personally;
i·. e. not by efficacy or assistance alone, but by hyposta-
ticalunion: so that the [ογος inhabiting or assuming, and
the nature inhabited or assumed, should be one person, or
one ὑφιςταμενον, one subslcmce. Whence it happens that the
Word is declared incarnate, and tlzat man is not α mere
man, sanctified and upheld by the Divine Spirit, but tlte
God-man. This Augustine briefly and perspicuously ex-
plains in these words, God took tlee tempora! substance ‹y‘the

that what is assumed becomes one with the person assum-
