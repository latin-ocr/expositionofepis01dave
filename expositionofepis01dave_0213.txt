Ver. 10. EPISTLE To Tur. COLossrANS. 127

as by a loving Father‚ not as an austere judge 3 as covered
and adorned with the most perfect obedience of Christ, not
as naked and alone. Lastly‚ The fallings and sins of the
faithful are indeed hateful and displeasing to God, but out
of a simple hatred‚ not redounding upon the person& And
therefore God hates sin in the regenerate, and for that rea-
son declares war against it, through the Spirit of grace;
but the regenerate themselves, in the mean time, are ac-
eeptable to him, and on that account he favours and
blesses them. And so much concerning the intention of
those who walk worthy of the Lord. We must proceed to
