Ver. 4. EPlSTLE To THE coLossmns. 367

Verses 4, 5.
And tlzis Isay, lest (my man should beguile you with en-
tich'ng words.
For tlzouglc I be absent in tlceflesh, yet am I with you in the
Spirit, josying and belzolding your order, and the sted-
fastness of yourfoidz in Christ.

In these two verses the Apostle assigns two reasons why
he laboured so much in confirming the Colossians. The
first is derived from the danger which threatened thern ς lest
any oue should beguile you, διο. The second from the love
dwelling in the Apostle’s heart3 For though Ι be absent,
&Q

And this Isau] These words are referred by some to
the verse immediately preceding, concerning all the trea-
sures of wisdom hid in Christ3 which the Apostle affirmed
with this view, lest being seduced by impostors, they
should think that the means of salvation should be sought
elsewhere. By others they are referred to all those things
which had been before stated in this Chapter3 as though
the Apostle had said, l would that ye knew my conflict
with those false teachers to have been undertaken for this
end, lest ye should be beguiled by their sophistical con-
ceits. It is of no importance to the main drift of the sub-
ject. For this is the meaning, that the Apostle strenuously
defends the true doctrine concerning our salvation reposed
in Christ alone, and on this account, lest the Colossians
attaching themselves to the ‘vain devices of men, this sav-
ing doctrine should be neglected.

Hence we learn,

l. That to preach and fully teach Christ and the bene-
fits of Christ, is to stop the way against all the idle and
superstitious inventions of men: for when Christ is rightly
known, those beggarly elements are held in contempt.
