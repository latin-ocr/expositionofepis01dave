down ageneral reason or rule whereby it may be under-
stood that they are to be rejected.

Beware lest am] man spoil you] Here he directs his dis-
course to the Colossians‚ and endeavours to render them
cautious in a twofold manner:

1. By this particle of attention, Beware lest. For this
strikes the mind much more pointedly than if he had said,
All the patches of men which are woven upon the Gospel
are to be rejected by Christians: For he who so speaks
seems to treat with the understanding alone; but he who,
with the Apostle, calls upon his hearer to take care that he
be not deceived by these fictions of men, he not only in—
structs the understanding, but moves the will and affec-
tions to hatred of the false doctrine. For by this form of
speaking he points out, as with a finger. the plots laid for
them, and the approaching deceiver: and thus sentinels,
when they have discovered the enemy, exclaim, Beware!
Take care 3 the enemy is upon you!

2. He excites them to the greatest caution by the ele-
gant metaphor of spoliation. For συλαγωγειν is to drive awa-es
the h001y; as robbers are accustomed to carry away men
and cattle with them, when they have prevailed in fight:
So the Amalekites, having plundered Ziklag, bore away
the men and all their goods, 1 Sam. xxx. By this word,
therefore, he shews the great danger that threatened them
from the seducers, who attacked them with the design to
bring them into bondege, as spoil taken in war3 viz. whilst
they led them from the Gospel to their impostures. This
mode of speaking, therefore, is very powerful to excite
their minds to attention and cantion.

Hence we derive some observations3

1. We are not to believe all who undertake to teach in
the Church: but must take care, and weigh with serious
examination, whether their doctrine be sound or not. This
the Popish teachers forbid, because they doubt of their
doctrine. This Apelles the heretic* heretofore forbade, as
it is stated in Enseb. lib. v. cap. 13, for lie said, z‘t icas not
