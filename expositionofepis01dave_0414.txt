328 AN EXPOSITION 01: sT. PAUL’s Chap. i.

How many and how great labours Paul underwent in
preaching the Gospel, we may ascertain from the Acts of
the Apostles. No one visited more people in preaching3
no one contended more strenuously with the enemies of the
Gospel in disputation3 in short, no one in any work of the
ministry exercised himself more earnestly by labour.
Whence he did not sear to assert, that he lead laboured more
abundantly than all tlte other Apostles, 1 Cor· xv. 10. This

Here learn,

1. That they who propose to themselves ease, pleasure,
nobes, or honour, are not suited for the Ministry of the
Gospel. For if the pastors of cattle undertake a laborious
life, so that Jacob could truly say concerning the pastoral
life, In the day the ἄνους-111 consumes] me, and the frost by
night ; aad ⁷⁷²²! sleep departed from mine eye& Gen. xxxi. 40,
then how much more does it behove the pastors of souls,
from whom God will require whatever shall be lost through
their indolence, to shrink from no labour? Is any one de-
