26 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAUL's Chap. i.

Erech-en] The Colossians, and so indeed all Christians
and faithful are called brechren for many reasons :

First, on account of their profession of one Religion, and
the worship of one and the same God. For Scripture calls
all those brethren who profess the same Religion. So Deut.
xviii. 20, Let not the Icing’s heart be lz'sted up against his
brethren3 and Matth. xxiii. 8, Be not γε called Rabbi;for
one is your Master, and all rye are BRETHREN. Secondly,
faithful and godly men are called bretlzren, because of the
fraternal affection and love which ever flourishes among
them. This fraternal charity the Apostles every where in-
culcate. Thus Rom. xii. 10, Be hindly affectioned one to
another with brotlzerly love. This brotherly love Tertullian
calls, tlzejewel of tlze Christian name: for true love is the
heritage of Christians. Thirdly, we are called brethren,
because we have one and the same father, i. e. God. For
all the godly are by regeneration and adoption children of
God himself, and thenceforward brethren with one another.
He gave them power to become tlze sons οἱ God, John i. 12.
Lastly, we are called brethren, because we are grafted into
the same mystical body of Christ, and are quickened by
one and the same spirit. As therefore they are brethren

naturally, who have derived natural life and descent from
the same parents3 so they are brethren spiritually who de-
rive their spiritual life and origin from the same principles.

Hence we are taught how great ought to be the concord

among Christians3 how far they ought to be removed from
hatred and envy3 how wicked it is to rejoice in the evil or

complied with the Emperor’s order, in sacrificing to idols. At his return to
Carthage, he held several Councils for the correction of evils which the
persecution had introduced, for settling the course to be pursued towards
such as professed repentanee, and for the due regulation of the Church.
But ere long he fell a sacrifice to that fidelity with which he retained and
laboured to commend the saith of the Gospel, being beileaded in the perse-
cution in 258. How important, then, does the principle adduced by our
Expositor, from him, appear, in considering the life and the times of Cy-
prian l Should such periods for “ the trial of the faith'' of professors now
arise, how many Libellatici would soon be discovered! It is a matter of
serious inquiry how many Cyprians would be found to exhibit, as well as
enforce, the qaz‘ckcning efficacy of raith, anda stedfast adherence to it?
