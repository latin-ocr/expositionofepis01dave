interpretem in two ways. Some give the meaning thus3

through the saith of the operation of Gocl, i. e. by the faith
which God works in every one of the faithful, by the faith
which springs from the Divine operation. But others exa
plain them thus3 through the saith (ff the operation of God,
i. e. by that saith which is directed to that wonderful opera-
tion of God which raised Christ again for ourjustification.
Whether we follow this latter or the former interpretation,
three things are to be noticed in these words of the Apos-
tle: The instrument by which we apprehend the treasures
of grace offered in baptism3 viz.faith: the Giver or the
worker of this saith, Coa, or the operation of God: the par-
ticular object which saith most especially regards in this
business, the power (ff God raising Christ againfrom the dead
for our salvation.

Thronghsaith] As to this first3 it is not in vain that
saith is required by the Apostle, that we may obtain the
benefit of spiritual resurrection. For, as in the baptism of
adults previous saith is required, according to that declara-
tion of our Saviour, Mar. xxi. 16, He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saresb and he that helieveth not shall be

baptism, the interna'l effect of sanctification they havenot.

who imagines baptism to consist in the carnal form, is not spi-
ritual: neither can he obtain the celestial gift, who trasts that
he can be changed by water, not hyfaith. We have a strong
and perspicuous reason for this3 viz. because the substance·
of the sacramente is Christ hiniself'3 all the virtue and vi-
tality of them is from Christ: but, indeed, Christ is not
approached by unbelievers; for men of this kind, whilst
they receive the sacraments, because their hearts are ἄγῃ
and their minds barren, they indeed lick the νοεῖς, bat sack
thence neither homey 7707· oil, as Cyprian somewhere says.

By way of profit, let us learn not to confide with Papists
in the opus operatum3 but enquire farther, whether we
