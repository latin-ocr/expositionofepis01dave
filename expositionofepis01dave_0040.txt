XXX LIFE 01³ BISHOP DAVENANT.

“ Nor had we cause to expect that in such publication of the
whole Synod's doctrinal consent, they should trouble their own
people, with expressing the dissent of some few of the exteri in
a matter of church discipline; which dissent of ours, they have
delineated in this second of their acts, though over-veiled for
their own peace, yet transparent enough for their own defence.

“ But it was our missortnne perhaps that he who turned over all
the leaves of the Belgic Confession there set forth, to find the

far and ever shall be from usurping our mother's authority, or at‘
tempting to obtrude upon her children any of our Synodical con-
clusions‚ as obligatory to them; yet remaining ourselves neverthe-
