Ver. 6. EPISTLE To THE cotoss1ANS. 97

observes, The wisdom of philosopher-s does not extirpate vices,
bat couceals them: the precepts of God change the whole
man, and, the old Adam being cast out, they render him A NEW
CREATURE. This is depicted in the Prophet Isaiah by an
elegant‘similitude, lv. 103 As the rain cometh down from
heaven, and retur-neth not thither again, bac watereth the earth
and maketh il bringforth and bud; so shall my word not re-
turn welo me void, bat ic shall accomplish that which I please,
and ic shall prosper in the thing whereto l sent it.

And on this passage, it is worth while to observe, that
the Apostle immediately subjoius the bearing of fruit to
the preaohing and hearing of the Gospel ε From which fact
he teaches us that the power of the Gospel, consists not so
much in the illumination of the understanding, as in the
reformation of the will. If this tree be not made good, and‘
produce not the good fruits of holiness and newness of
life, in vain we glory in the Gospe13 which falls upon un—
holy rnen not as a benefit, but as their condemnation. Heb.
vi. 7, The earth which drinloetlz in the rain that cometh [ft upon
it, and bearelh thorus and briars, is rejected ancl is nigh anto
cur-sing.

And increaseth] This is found in various copies, and
is expressed by the Syriae translation ς which words
shew the efficacy of the Gospel in the multitude of those
professing it. For it is said to increase when the number
of those increases who embrace the Christian saith. And
truly in this sense the Gospel has increased to a misaele,
The Grecian philosophy (says Clemens) ij any magistratepro-
hibited it, immediately died away ,· hat the Kimgs (ff the earth
opposed the Christian doctrine, and yet it increased. The
Church had been harassed by ten continual persecutions

unsound. St. Jerome remarked with truth‚ that he was better able to de-
stroy the errors of the heathen, than to maintain the doctrine of Christians ;
and onr learned Bishop Bull, whom no one will accuse of depreciating the
ancient Ecclesiastical writers, says, ‘⁴ that he knew little of Christianity,
was ignorant of Scriptum, and was never reck01ied among the doctors of the
Church.‘' Stil] he couldjudge of the effects of Christianity on the lives and
morals of its subjects, and the citation of him by our Expositor, as a wit-
ness from an ⁶⁶ Imperial Court,” is powerful ; and goes to prove, as in
other instances, how conversant Davenant was with the best authors.
