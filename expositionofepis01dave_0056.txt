the Church: this, he judged‚ was the great fault of the Tridentino
and late Westminster assemblies : but our Church was more in-
genuons, and left these dark and curious points to the several
apprehensions of learned men, and extended eqnal communion to

both.’'

That the views of Davenant were such as bear the name of sub-
lapsarian Calvinism‚ all his writings prove* It has, however,
been said, that with respect to the doctrine of Universal Redemp-
tion, he was led by Abp. Usher. This is distinctly stated by
Baxter; and from this it has been inferred by many, that the views
of Davenant underwent a change, and that he declined to the
opinion that redemption is attainable by all. In fact, the extraor-
dinary endowments of the Irish primate, his stupendous and uni-
versal erudition, his extreme moderation, humility, fervent piety‚
and judgment, placed him in correspondence with all the learned
men of Europe of all ehurches, who appealed to him for infor-
mation and advice upon almost every topic of learning and theo-
logy‚† When in London, “ the most eminent divines were wont
to apply themselves to him as a father.''‡ Among others, Dave-
nant was on close terms of intimacy with him; and to this the
following passage of Baxter refers, in the year 1658, seventeen
years after our Author's death: “ In the time of my abode at
Lord Broghill’s, fell out all the acquaintance Ι had with the most

113) “ Davenant had adopted the supralapsarian hypothesis, i. e. of un-
conditional predestination in the utmost sense.'’ This gentlenian‘s definition
of the doctrine is well-suited to his accuracy of assertion. He has, how-
ever, favoured the world with more than one choice specimen of his theo-
logical attainment3 suited, indeed, to what might be expected from a man,
who, in narrating a witty story of Bishop Thomas, concerning a Lutheran
divine who refused to bury a Calvinist‚ sagely observes: “ Although the
Calvinism of the dead be not contagious, it may fairly be doubted whether
a known her-etio is entitled to have the service read over him, and to receive
. the same honours with one dying in the true saith of the Church. 111 this
case, no doubt, the Clergynian was acting in conformity to the spirit ofthe
Rubric- For a Calvinist must, ipsoflcctO, be ‘ excommunicate :' and such,
we know, are not eutitled to Christian burial.” The Reader will positively
find this delectable passage in part ii. p. 316, of the above-mentioned vo-
lume.
