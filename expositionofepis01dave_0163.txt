Ver. 5. ΕΡῐετιΕ το ‘rim conossxANs. 77

that they may become partakers of the communion of
saints and of eternal blessedness: Therefore the godly
man hates the wicked inan, but with α perfect haered: but
a perfect hatred is that which is neither defective in justice,
nor knowledge, i. e. that you neither hate the men on ac-
count of their vices, nor love the vices on account of the
men.

From these considerations, therefore, it is manifest, that
Christian love embraces every rational creature except
devils and the damned ; because all either are, or at *least
as far as we know, may be partakers of holiness and bless-

God has forsaken them: therefore we cannot desire to them
the good of eternal life, to which love chiefly has respect5
because this would be repugnant to love, which approves
the justice of God, and acquiesces in his revealed will.

And these things may suffice concerning the virtue of
love, the object, and the extent ofthe object: and having
dwelt so long upon these heads, we must pass over the in-
ferences which might be drawn either for instruction, or for
direction, or even reproof, and proceed.

of his giving of thanks, viz. the faith and love of the Co-
lossians: now he proceeds to illustrate and confirm the
same, from the final and instrumental causes. The final

cause, tlze lzope laid up in heaven: the instrumental cause,
tltewordcff the Gospel. But because the connection and
even the sense of these words is disputed‚ these doubts

must be cleared away, before we proceed to treat the sub-
ject matter.

Some connect these words, because <ff the hope which is laid
upsoryou, with that expression, we give chanlm, which is
placed in the beginning of the third verse, in this sense;
We give thanks to God having heard of your faith and
