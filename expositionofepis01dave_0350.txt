ture underheuvem] This is the second reason why it be-
hoved the Colossians to continue in that doctrine of the
Gospel which they had learned of Epaphras3 namely, be-
cause it was the same with that which the Apostles had
disseminated through the whole world. For although the
truth of the Gospel does not rest upon human authority or
approbation, or the number of believers, yet the consent
of all the churches in receiving the same doctrine, contri-
butes much to the confirmation of our saith.

But what the Apostle here says, that the Gospel was
preached to everis creature, is taken in various ways by in-
terpreters3 yet in this they agree, that under the designa-
tion creature, should be understood only the rational crea-
ture, viz. mankind3 because they alone can comprehend
and need the doctrine of the Gospel. And so the Saviour
himself speaks, Μαι-1( xvi. 15, (ἕο ye into all the world, and

But it being admitted, that by every creature we must
understand all men, yet some doubt may arise how the
Gospel can be said to have been preached to all men, since
it is very probable, that in the time of the Apostles, many
existed who were not made partakers of the Gospel.

Some, therefore, reply, that there is a certain hyperbo-
lical synecdoche in these words, nor could the Apostle
mean any thing else than that the doctrine of the Gospel
was disseminated far and wide. -Others think that the pre-
terite is put for the future, which was customary in pro-
phetical predictions, to denote the certainty of future
things Because, therefore, the Gospel was at that time
