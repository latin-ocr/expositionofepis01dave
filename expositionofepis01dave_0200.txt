serve, that without ceasiug I malfe mention of you always in
my prayers, &c. Rom. i. 9.

Neither let any one here object, that men of remarkable
holiness, such as were Samuel and Paul, might help the
people of God by their constant prayers; but that other
ministers who are destitute of this holiness, cannot: For
well hath Augustine taught, that even wicker] priests are
heard when they praysor their flochs, although they are not
heard when they prayfor themselves, contra Epist. Parmen.
lib. ii. cap 8. And so much concerning the importunity of
the Apostle's prayer : What follows is concerning its vehe-
ment devotion.

To pray and lo desire] In these two words the Apostle
intimates the devotion and even the vehemency of his
prayer for the Colossians. Some by the word προσευχόμενοι,

kindled ancl inflamed is most efficacious‚ so as to penetrate
the very heavens. Eut when he says that he desired, αἰπεῖα-θαι,
for them, he signifies the veheinence of his petition: for
'‘anno-15, desire, is the entreating for necessary things. He
therefore so prayed to God for the spiritual progress of the
Colossians, as men are wont to intreat others for the things
which they greatly need.

God ought always to open the way to our particular peti-
