474 AN EXPOSlTlON or ετ. νΛυιίε, Chap. ii.

Now faith easily conceives that the devil was spoiled by
the death of Christ3 because mankind are plucked from his
jaws, and his dominion is broken and diminished. For he
held us bound with the chain of our sins.- his bonds, there-
fore, being broken asunder, he is stripped of his prey, and
we are delivered. Hence Augustin, De Trinit. lib. 4, says,
From whence tlte devil received the power of externally wound-
ing tltefless'z of tlte Lord, from thence lzis z'nward power, which
held us captive, was slain. So also we in like manner say,
that he was made a shew (ff, i. e. treated with the completest
shame and ignominy, as captives are wont. Neither is he
without reason said to be made a shew of, i. e. to be over-
whelmed with shame like those who are led captive: for
when he hoped utterly to have devoured Christ, he himself
beyond all expectation was devoured by the death of Christ.
Therefore‚ as when gladiators engage, if he who has laid
the other prostrate, and almost dispatched him by wounds,
should receive a deadly thrust, and be overcome by him
who was wounded‚ and just ready to die, becomes loaded
with the greatest dishonour; so Christ loads the devil with
the greatest ignominy, because, being crucified and dead,
he, notwithstanding, in like manner overcame and subdued
him. And this he is said to have done εν παρρηςία, i. e. as
some translate it, openly; because Christ died openly upon
the Cross, and thus, as in the sight of the whole world,
conquered the devil: or, as others translate it, boldlgy ; be-
cause he intrepidly engaged with the devil, and subdned
him by his death, knowing for certain that he, by this
mode, should overturn the kingdom of the devil.

To come now to the last words, he is also said to have
triumphet} over the devil ἐν ἀυτω”, in it, i. e. upon lzis cross:
because, as Origen very properly remarks, two are under-
stood to have been affixed to the σφωε,- Clzrist visilffy, (f lze‘s
own will, for a time ; the devil invisibly, against his will, and
Jbr ever. The eye of faith‚ therefore, regards Christ, sit-
ting on the summit of the cross, as in a triumphal chari0t;
the devil bound to the lowest part of the same cross, and
trodden under the feet of Christ. Or, if we read ἐν αὑτῶ,
in himself, it must mean, by leis own power, with no military
