Others byfaithful, understand those who persevere in
saith received. For it is very probable that some were
drawn away from evangelical doctrine by those who, in the
place of the Gospel, obtruded philosophical speculations
and Jewish ceremonies. By this term therefore he both com-
mends those who remained stedfast in the true doctrine of
saith, and obliquely rebukes others, who, following those
new teachers‚ turned aside from the saith of the Gospel to
errors and superstitions3 and he points them out as un-
worthy his salutation. Therefore to be initiated into the
Christian profession by baptism avails nothing unless there·
be a stedfast continuance in the same. Notfaz'tlz received,

Cyprian could with peculiar propriety and emphasis deliver such a principle
as the above, since, during the severity of the persecution under Decius, about
the years 249 and 250, he had witnessed and proved the results of a mere
profession of the saith, and the effects of its abiding infiuence in the heart.
He too had experienced in himself all its power, and at last died a martyr
to his stedfastness in the succeeding persecution under Valerian and Galli-
enus. His parents were heathens, and he himself had continued such to an
advanced period in life. His conversion was brought about by one Coeci-
lius, a priest of the Church of Carthage, whose name he afterwards took ;
and who entertained so high an opinion of Cyprian's character as to commit
to him the care ot' his family at his death. Cyprian had often employed his
rhetoric (of which science he had been long an able teacher) in defence of
Paganisn13 but on his conversion, as a proof of his sincerity‚ he composed
a treatise entitled “ De Gratia Dei,'' which he addressed to Donatusz he
next composed a piece, ‘⁴ De Idolorum Vanitate.” His behaviour both be-
fore and after his baptism was so highly pleasing to the Bishop of Carthage,
that he very soon ordained him a priest‚ when he consigned over all his
goods to the poor, and gave himself wholly to divine things. The Bishop
dying the year after, none was judged so proper to succeed him as Cyprian.
Compelled soon afterwards to flee from Carssmge, to avoid the fury of the
persecutore whom Decius had let loose, and whose cry was “ cyprian to tlte
lions‚” he wrote in the place of his retreat, picus and instructive letters to
his flock, and also to the Libellatici‚ or those pusillanimous Christianis, who
procured certificatos of the heathen magistrates to shew that they had
