Ver. 16. prs'rmz To THE conosslANS. 189

lingly concur in this opinion because the Apostle himself
says, condita, not cognita ‚· i. e. made, not designed; and also
because in the end of the verse, resuming what he had said
after a long parenthesis, he uses the word δι’”αυτο”υ, by him,
thereby plainly shewing that he considered these words
equivalent.

The argument therefore is most valid--Christ is not a
creature, but before all creatures3 because by him they
were made. For that which makes is before the thing
made, not only in. cause, buc in time also, as the Philosopher
rightly observes, De part. animal. i. l.

But here some person may object that we are solving
’ one obscurity by the introduction of a still greater ; inas-
much as it may be disputed, whether Christ is the Maker
of all things, or not.

l answer, The Apostle is writing· to the Colossians, not Ι
to Pagans, but to Christians3 and therefore takes it for
granted that they allow Christ to be not a mere man, but
the incarnate Word; which being allowed, it follows that
he is the Maker of all creatures, John i., lee word was in
the beginning with God: ALL ‘rfflNcs WERE MADE ΒΥ
ΗιΜ, AND WITHOUT HIM WAs Nor ANY TniNG MADE.

Thac are in heaven, and that are 'in earth, visible and invi-
sible,] What he had just asserted, that all things were
made by Christ, he now illustrates by a twofold division of
things created z the former of which is drawn from the dif-
ferent locality of the things created; the latter, from their
different qualities.

In heaven and in earth] In this division he comprehends
the whole creation. For under the term heaven he under-
stands, as is customary in Scripture, the Highest Heaven‚
the abode of angels and of the blessed ; the starry sky also,
in which are fixed the heavenly orbs3 and the atmospheoe,
in which meteors and other volatile bodies do move ; When
he says in earth, he means not only all things which are on
the snrface, but those also which are subterraneous3
such as are laid up in the bosom and bowels of the earth,
and in the sea likewise, Which surrounds the earth, and with
it makes up one sphere. Thus Moses himself speaks, Gen. i.
