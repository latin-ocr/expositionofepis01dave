Ver. 14. EPlsTLE To THE coLosslANs. 467

friendly and wholesome. Let us, therefore, acknowledge,
that it is not by the fault of the law, or of the Lawgiver,
but our own, that this hand-writing is rendered deadly to
us.

2. As to the rites and ceremonies ε Since the Apostle
pronounces them to be contrary to us, they are reproved
who would restore Judaism, and burden the Church with
useless and unprofitable ceremonies, and beguile Christians
of the liberty acquired by the cross of Christ.

From the abolition, we learn,

l. Since this hand-writing of the law is abrogated and
blotted out as to its condemnatory power, we infer, that it
yet retains its directing force. We may not, therefore, take ,
from hence a licence of sinning, but alacrity in serving
God3 for we are delivered from all our sins, and from all
our enemies by the death of Christ, not that we may grow
wanton in sin, but that we may serve God withoutfear in Ιιο-
liness and righteousness all οιιν days, Luke i. 74, 75.

2. Since the comfort of a troubled conscience consists
in the blotting out of this hand-writing3 we must labour
to maintain‚ by a sure saith, not only that Christ has pro-
cured the blotting out of this hand-writing, but, more-
over, that in fact it is blotted out as respects ourselves.
Since, asin a case of debt‚ no one thinks himself suffi-
ciently safe until he sees with his own eyes, or, at least,
knows for certain, that his bond is cancelled: so, in this
case of sin, we‘shall not be at peace, till we see by the
eyes of saith that the hand-writing of our sins is blotted
out by the blood of Christ.
