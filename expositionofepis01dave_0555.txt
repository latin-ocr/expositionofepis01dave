Ver. 15. EPIS'BLE 'ro 'rna eonossiANs. 469

quered and triumphed, not by the valour and the exertions
of others, as earthly conquerors do; but by his passion
alone, or in his own individual power.

Let us proceed, however, to a more explicit treatment of
the words themselves3 in which these two things may be
considered: l. Who were these enemies, whom the Apos-
tle asserts‚ were spoiled, made α slzew of, and triumphed over?
Principalities and powers. 2. Of what kind this spoiling,
making α εΙιεω, and triumph were. For since these words
are figurative, they must be reduced to some proper and
perspicuous sense.

l. Principalz'ties and powers] By these two titles he
designates the enemies conquered by Christ, namely, wick- ι
ed daemons‚ enemies of our salvation. And they are termed
principalities ancl powers, because they have usurped the
chief power and rule over men 3 as appears from Ephes. vi.
12, where they are called the rulers of this world. And 2
Tim. ii. 26, the devil is said to hold men ensnared ancl capn're
at lzz's will. Hence he is compared in Luke xi.2l, to a
strong man armed, who, having expelled another from his
house, holds whatsoever he finds there by force. They are
denominated principalitz'es ancl powers, therefore, in this
place, for this reason in particular, because mankind are
held, afflicted, and harassed under their tyrannical rule.
But inasmuch as commanders and generals are never con-
quered alone, but we understand by their being conquered‚
that their army was likewise overcome and put to ssight:
as when we say that Hannibal was vanquished by Scipio, or
Pompey by Caesar, we should be understood to mean not
them alone3 but that with them the Carthaginians and the
forces of Pompey were all vanquished. These spiritual ,
principalities and powers, therefore, being subdued, what-
ever with them militated against human salvationis likewise
laid prostrate3 the old Adam, death, hell, the world, and
our sins; for all these were enemies to us, being troops
confederate with the devil. The Scriptures, then, affirm,
that not the devil alone was vanquished by Christ, but also
all those other foes who supported his kingdom, and were
accustomed to promote our bonclage under him. Coucern-
