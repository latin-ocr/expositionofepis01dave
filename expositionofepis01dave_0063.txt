IT is not my present purpose to touch upon the assertions os
Papists concerning seven degrees or orders of spiritual offices,
especially since they are themselves compelled to confess that all
below the Deaconate have been added. My only dispute is con-
cerning Episcopacy and Presbytery, Nor shall I here subtilly
contend, whether Episcopacy be a distinct order from Presbytery,
or only another and higher degree in the same order. William of
Paris distinctly affirms that Episcopacy is not an order, but an
honour,· which is also maintained by Gerson, whose words are
these: There is not another power of order in Biskops than in
Presbyters, but the same is there in α more perfect mode. Fi-
nally‚ Durandus (lib. 4. dist. 24) is ofthe same opinion ε Episcopacy,
says he, is not an order strictly distinct from the simple Ρνίεετήοοά,
but the distinction between them is of PERFECT and IMPERFECT.
Hither tends the argument of the Schoolmen, that the Episcopate‚ as
distinguished from the simple priesthood, is not another order:
but a more eminent power and dignity of certain who are in the
same sacerdotal order. It is sufficient for us, (laying aside this
verbal contenti0n‚) to shew that *those who are peculiarly called
Bishops have a higher dignity, greater power, and more excellent
offices annexed to them than other Presbyters have, and that this
is not repugnant to the word of God, But it were trivial to say,
not repuynant; for it is easy to demonstrate, that in the Divine
word, this eminence of Bishops above Presbyters is shadowed out,
delineated, and by the Apostles themselves established,
