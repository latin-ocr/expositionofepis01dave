which is read at table in the College of the Jesuits every
mouth, and seriously commands, that those things which
the Superior enjoins, they should simply perform with
a blind obedience, not considering whether what is

eventful aera. The change in his views which led to this, resulted on his
pondering over the lives of some of the Romish Saints, during a long con-
finement under wounds, received at the siege of Pampeluna, against the
French, in 1521. On his recovery, he hung up his arms in the Church of
M ontserrat, and dedicated himself to the blessed Virgin. The character of
theman, and the circumstance which so affected his subsequent proceed-
ings, by his mind taking a direction for Religion, was thus described by the
celebrated Vieira (one of his Order), in a Sermon which he preached in
Lisbon in reference to him some years after. ‘⁶ The Cids, the Pelayos, the
Geryons, the Hercules who had figured in Spain, roused his spirit to covet
an heroic resemblance. Their celebrity stimulated him. N avarre seemed-
a small point of defence3 the Pyrenees but inferior walls3 and all France
but a petty conquest. He considered that he was a captain, a Spaniard, and
had been conquered. lVeary with combating thoughts so vast, he called
for a book of chivalry to amuse himself, but he could only find a volume of
the lives of saints. It' it had been what he wished, it would have led him
to be afamous knight, but, being what it> was, it made him a great saint.
Instead of being a cavalier of a flaming sword, he became the saint of a
burning torch- At first the contents displeased him, but he became asto-
nished, as he read, to find that there was in the world another scene of sol-
diership, quite new, and unknown to him before: and he resolved to be-
come one of its most zealous members. He took off his noble collar, he
laid down his helmet, he stripped off his armour, and offered up the sword
which he had valued above all things, as the first tribute of his new feel-
ings, on the altar of Montserrat. After passing through various scenes as
a mendicant, a student, and a preacher, he became at last the founder of
that sect which assumed the name of the Company of Jesus; a sect which
arose to uphold the Popedom, till its final consummation of iniquity, just at
the time that the temporal power of the Pope received a blow, from which
it has never recovered, by the attack of the Duke of Bourbon upon Rome,
and the sacking of the great city, in 1527, by his Colleague in arms, and
successor in that extraordinary event—the Prince of Orange. The Order
was organized about 1530, and on its resolving upon a vow of submission to
Pope Paul 111„ he, in 1540, established it by a Papal Bull, under the title
of ‘² the Society of Jesus.” Hence they received the epithet of Jesuits3
and thus was created an Order, when, as Hume justly remarks, “ the
Court of Rome perceived that the lazy Monks and Mendicant Friars, who
sufficed in times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend the ramparts
of the Church, assailed on every side ς and that the inquisitive spirit of the
age required a Society more active and more learned to oppose its dangerous
progress.’' The Papacy was not disappointed3 for the Society has been
proverbial for their inti-ignes in nearly every State on the sace of the Globe.
