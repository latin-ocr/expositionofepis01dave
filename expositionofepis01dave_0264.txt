into the world on purpose that he might renew man, fallen
and shamefully corrupted. Only by this image (ff God can
you be conformet} to the image qf' God, says Ambrose, De
fide, lib. i. cap. 4.

Now let it suffice to have spoken thus much concerning
the Son, as far as in himself he is the invisible, eternal,
and natural image of God the Father before the foundation
of the world. But Christ must also be regarded as far as

pressed, the recent admirable volume of Dr. Burton on the “ Testimony of
the Fathers‚'' may be strongly recommended. We cannot, however, but
regret, that this able writer should have dismissed a subject of such vital
importance, without an exhibition of the practical efficat-y of the orthodox
system.

Sabellius was an African Presbyter or Bishop, who lived in the century
preceding Arius„ and gave name to the heresy next adverted to by our Ex-
positor. The notions said to have been maintained by him in systematizing
and vindicating errors previously broached‚ and to account for the glmious
declarations of the Gospel and the great Mystery of Godliness which it un-
folds, are curious indeed. But his history and opinions are involved in
great obscurity. He is generally stated to have held, as the foundation of
his heresy, that, (in the words of Bishop Bull), “ God was but one person ;
and that there was no real distinction, much less division of persons, in the
Divine essence;” and against this the arguments of Davenant are levelled.
The learned Mosheim‚ however, does not hesitate to prononnce, that “ this
is in great part false.'' In his ‘⁶ Commentaries'' lie has entered copiously
into the whole review of what is to be gathered fron] the ancients concern-
ing this heresiarch3 and seems to have proved that his heresy has been con-
founded with that of Noetus. The summary of his investigation is, that
‘⁵ the opinion of Sabellius is not the same with that of Noetus; for the
former did not suppose, as the latter seems to have done, that the person of
the Deity was in entire simplicity one, and that it had assumed and ‘joined
to itself the human nature of Christ3 but that a certain energy, emitted
from the Father, or rather a part of the person and nature of the Father,
was joined to theman Christ3 and that this virtue, or part of the Father,
was the Holy Spirit‚” (p. 688).-13ut these, and the above-mentioned errors
and subtleties, are not befitting us to dwell upon. They are evidently not
to be sustained by the iVord of God; and our Expositor, from that foun-
tain of truth, overturns them at once3 and, if the foundations be destroy-
ed, what shall the foolish builders do? It need only be added, that the
reader who desires fai-ther information‚ as to the history and progress of these
or other errors, and has not more ample means of obtaining it, οι· who
would find the works mentioned in the preceding article of a literary cha-
racter beyond his attainments, will in Grier's “ Epitome of the General
Councils of the Church,'' and Douglas's “ Errors of Religion‚'’ meet with

suitable satisfaction.
