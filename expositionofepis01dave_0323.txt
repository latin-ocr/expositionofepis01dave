Ver. 20. EPISTLE To THE coLoss1ANs. 237

the good pleasure of God, and from his eternal love,
whereby us, who were fallen and sunk in sin, he hath volun-
tarily saved and reconciled to himself: according to that
saying of Ambrose in Epist. ll, God called us to salvation
when we‘were straying from him, and not even desiring the
right way ; and Paul to Titus, ii. ll, lee grace of God which
bringetlz salvation, appeared wito all men, Ἐπεφάνη n χάριςς as
it were, shone upon us suddenly and unexpectedly, when
we were neither seeking or looking for such a thing.

3. Let us proceed, and see, in the third place, to whom
we are reconciled. To himself} says the Apostle‚ i. e. to
God the Father, and, consequently, to the whole Trinity.
So he speaks in many places: Rom. v. 10, When we were
enemies we were reconciled to God hy the death of leis Son : and
in 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ reconciling tlte world: To ,

tion and remission of it.

But two reasons are assigned by Zanchiusfiss (De trib.
Elohim‚) why the Scriptures usually teach that we are re-

* Jerome Zanchius, born of an illustrious family at Bergamo, in 1516,
became a member of the congregation of canons regular of St. Giovanni di
Laterano, when only fifteen years of age, and while in that society formed
a close intimacy with the celebrated Peter hIartyr, also an associate of their
community. The conversation and example of this distinguished convert
to the reformed chureii, made a great impression upon Zanchius, as well as
upon many of his brethren, which was fai-ther increased by the lecturas
which Peter subsequently delivered at Lueca. The result, though not im-
mediate, was decisive ; and Zamhius, after having worn the monastic habit
nearly twenty years, at length threw it off, in conjunction with eighteen of
his cmnpanhms, and openly seceded from the Romish communion. This
abjuration necessarily induced him to quit Italy; and accordingly, in 1550,
