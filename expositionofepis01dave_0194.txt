108 AN EXPOSl'l‘loN or ST. PAUL’S Chap. 1.

Verse 8. Wleo also declared unco us your love in the
spirit.

Paul has commended the faith and love of the Colos-
sians, when yethe was unknown to them by face, as ap-
pears from Ch. ii. 1 : Therefore some one might have asked,
Whence, Paul, could you have this knowledge of us and
of our affairs? He meets this question, and shews that he
has not commended them rashly, but he had discovered
and ascertained all by the relation of Epaphras, a most
competent witness.

Who also declared.] He shews the author of the rela-
tion, which he does in order that he might gain favour for
Epaphras among them ε forit is natural to all to love those
whom they have understood to think and speak honourably
concerning them.

And here it is to be observed, how faithful a minister of
Christ Epaphras was, not only in preaching the Gospel,
but in exciting the minds of men to mutual love. For, as
it is likely he had declared to the Colossians, how great
an Apostle Paul was, with what admirable knowledge,
with what singular zeal, he was distinguished3 and thus
excited in theirminds an admiration and wondrous love of
Paul; then he goes to Paul and explains how much affec-
tion there was in the Colossians towards him. This, then,
is the duty of an ingenuous and picus man, to promote
love and charity among all 3 not to sow the seeds of hatred
and strife.

Your lova] Here the Apostle touches upon the chief
head of his relation: for he had said many good things to
Paul concerning them, but had particularly extolled their
love· Some refer this their love to all the saints 3 but inas-
much as he had commended that in the fourth verse, the
opinion of Chrysostom is the more probable, who refers it
to the Apostle Pau13 which also the following words seem
to intimate.

Ιη the Spirit, or, through the spiriu] Two reasons are
assigned by interpreters, why he states their love to be in
tlte Spiric.
