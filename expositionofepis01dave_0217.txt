Ver. 10. EPISTLE To THE coLossmNs. 131

The Apostle alludes to that increase in our spiritual sta—
ture, concerning which he also speaks in Ephes. iv. 13,
where he shews‚ that we must increase 1111 we all come in
the unify of the saith, and (ff 1116 knowledge of 1116 Son of
God, 111110 a perfect man, 111110 1116 measure (gf 1116 stature of
chefulness (ff Chasa—We observe,

1. Increase in knowledge is no less necessary to a
Christian inan, than fruitfulness in works 3 because we are
bound to both by the divine command, and we are taught
to seek both from God by Apostolic example.

2. From the circumstance of the Apostle joining these
two, he wishes to intimate that fruitfulness in works can-
not exist, without this progress in wisd01n3 nor progress in
wisdom and the true knowledge of God, without fruitfulm

The reason of the former is this; Because wisdom so
directs the operation of virtue, as sight does the walking
faculty. Take away sight, and no one can walk aright3
take away wisd01n‚ and he cannot be fruitful as he ought.
For that action is bad which is not directed by knowledge,
although it belong to the class of the goodflss And the rea-
son of the latter is, because the desire and the practice of
holiness is, by the divine oeconomy, a certain preparation
for obtaining more abundant knowledge from G0d; and 011
the other hand, the neglect ofholiness and good works, is the
cause why God inflicts spiritual blindness, and gives men
over to a reprobate mind. [understand more than 1116 αη-

arises the study of holiness and the practice of good
works3 so again from this fruitfulness knowledge itself
takes a new increase: as also from ignorance arises an
abandoned life3 so again, from this abandoned life, igno-
