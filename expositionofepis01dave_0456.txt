370 AN EXPOSITlON OF ST. PAUIJS elzap. ii.

deceive. Under this word the Apostle coniprehends rheto-
rical and fiattering insinuations, sophistical and intricate
subtleties ; with which they endeavoured either to insinu-
ate or force an entrance into the minds of men. In short3
whatever is so flattering to human reason, by its specious
colouring, as to lead a man from Christ, is to be referred to
the pernicious entz'cz'ng words. This deceitful sophistry the
Apostle condemns in l Cor. ii. 4. Not that persuasiveness
qs words is in itself condemnable, for it is a great excel-
lence of speech3 but the abuse of it, when it acts by ap-
parent, but false reasons, and is employed to impose upon
men.

Concerning that insinuating persuasiou, Tertullian, in
writing against Valentinus, clearly speaks, Imposlors have
tlze art to persuade bcffore they teaclz ; but trutlz persuades by
leuching, not teaclzes hy persuading. Concerning that so-
phistry, Prudentius formerly complained3

Fidem minutis dissecant ambagibus,
Ut quisque lingua est nequior3
Solvunt ligantque quaestionum vincula
Per syllogismos plectiles,

Vae captiosis sycophantarum strophis,
Vae versipelli astutiae.ig

But [it may be said] how can there be such enticement
in those in whom there is no truth? For (ifwe believe the
Philosopher) things which are true are more easily reduced
to tlze slzape ofargument‚ ancl more persuasz've, than salse ones
are. Rhet. i. 6.

This is the solution : They are so indeed, both in them-
selves and in their nature3 but as it regards the unskilful
and external appearance, many false things seem more pro-
bable than many true ones· And that happens, because

³* Thus attempted—

Faith into nieest subtleties is split‚

As each is furnished with more wicked wit;
The Casuists' knot alike to tie or loose,

The tortuous syllogism's found of use:
Shame on the quibbling turns of arts untrue l
Shame upon stillae-ies of varying hue Ξ
