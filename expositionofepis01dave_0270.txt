shall see God. Matth. v. 8. It behoves us tojbllow peace ancl
lmliuess, without which no one shall see the Lord. To con-
clude, in one word: If any hope or desire dwell in us of
ever seeing him who is invisible, always let us bear in
mind that of St. John, l Epist. iii. 2, 3, leen Gocl shall
appear, we shall see lzim aslze is.- And every man that laath

And so far concerning the comparison of Christ to

T lte first-born of every creature] Here the Apostle de-
scribes the Redeemer by comparison with the creatures, and

in what manner you may understand hotlz expressions concern-
