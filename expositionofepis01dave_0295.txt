Ver. 17. EPlSTLE To THE comssrANs. 209

Adam, aad others, whose perfectiores, when left to themselves,
what were they, butan increase (ff the weight to their down-
fall?

3. For persuading us to obedience ; since it is but rea-
sonable that all our life should be devoted to serving Him
by whom we were both brought into this life, and are sus-
tained in it. Thus the Psalmist reasons, Ps. c. 2, Praise
the Lord with gladness ‚· come before hz‘s presence with a song ;
be με sure that the Lord he is God, for He hath made us, and
not we ourselzes.

Lastly‚ let. us add this consideration: that these things
are not so to be appropriated to Christ, as to exclude either
God the Father, or the Holy Ghost, from the preservation
of the creature. For, as they said at the creation of man,
Let us make marm so could these three persons say, let us·
preserve man. And what has been said of man the same
might be said of all creatures3 viz. that all were both at
first created, and are still preserved by the united opera-
tion of the whole Trinity. For that saying of Augustine,
De Trinit. lib. i. cap. 4, is most true, The persons are insepar-
able, and operate inseparably.

And thus much concerning the character of the Redeem-
er, derived from a comparison of him with the creature
formed τ We must come to the last part of this character,

derived from his relation to the creature renewed‚ i. e. to
the Chureh.
