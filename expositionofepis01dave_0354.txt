⁴268 AN EXPOSlTlON 01³ ετ. PAUL's Chal). i.

sians, was yet of great celebrity among all the churches ;
for his wonderful conversion and his call to the Apostleship
were matters of great notoriety among them. If, therefore,
every man in his own calling z's zoorlhy of credit, then ought
Paul, who was set apart for the preaching of the gospel, to
be credited concerning the truth of the Gospel rather than
the false Apostles: But this Paul approved the doctrine of
Epaphras; therefore ought the Colossians to continue init.
Three things are here to be observed.

1. Christians must not lend their ears to those who un-
dertake the office of preaching when they have not a legi-
timate call to it. For the Apostle seems in this place to
oppose his lawful ministry to that of those seducers who
had crept into the ehurch of the Colossians, relying upon
their own temerity not upon the Divine appointment. No
wonder, therefore, if those who possessed not lawful autho-
rity to teaoh at all, should teach falsehood. Such were
they who wished to lead away the Colossians from the
Gospel3 but, nevertheless, they must continue in it.

2. That no one can exercise the public office of the
Ministry, unless he can say with Paul, that he is made α
minister of tlze Gospel. Therefore a call is to be looked for,
from the authority either of (iod giving a special revelation, or
(ff α superior giving α mission, or of inevilable necessz'1‘y; as
Gerson properly asserts, par. 3. Upon those who act
otherwise, that sentence of Jeremiah, xxiii. 21, is deser-
vedly launched, Ι have not sent tlzese proplzets, yet they r'arz;
I lzave not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

Lastly, That legitimate Pastors themselves are to be
only minister-s of the Gospel, not lords; according to that
saying of Paul, 2 Cor. i. 24, We have not domz'nion over your
saith, but are helpers ofyour joy. The true Apostles, con-
tent witlzmz'niscering only, left all authority in matters of
saith to God. But our well known sels-erected apostle in
sheep's clothing arrogates to himself the authority of crea-
ting new doctrines of saith, and of imposing them upon
Christian people under anathema: nay more, that whatever
he happens to dream when placed in his chair of authority⁷
