Ver. 13. EPISTLE To THE coLossrANS. 159

merable others, it is manifest that we have need not only
of such admonishing grace, but of that which changes,

heals, liberates, and translates 3 for without such grace no
one gets out of the kingdom of Satan.

Therefore He is to be regarded with the highest and un-
ceasing honour who has translated us into this kingdom:

for so are colonies accustomed to honour their founder,

Into tlze kingdom] Let us inquire now what is intended
by this word kingdom. The kingdom of God, or tlte king-
dom of Christ, or the kingdom of heaven, in sacred Scripture
denotes many things.

1. First, it is put for the state of glory and blessed-
ness: as when we are commanded to seck tlte kingdom of
God, Matth. vi. 333 when [it iss-aid] the ungodly shall not
inleerit tlze kingdom os God, l Cor. vi. 9. If we understand
tlte kingdom of the Son in this manner, then God must be
said to have translated his people into this kingdom, inas-
much as they have a right to it, and possess it in hope, al-
though notin reality. But this does not seem to me to
accord with the desig-n of the Apostle in this place.

enlighten, and sanctify the soul, was one Morgan, (a name of the same sig-
nification as Pelagius,) said to be a native of XVales, born in 354, and edu-
cated in the Monastery of Bangor, of which he became Abbot. In the
early part of his life he went to France, and from thence to Rome3 where,
about the year 400, he commenced formally and systematically to promul-
gate his opinions. His morals being irreproachable, he gained many disci-
ples 3 but his errors were promptly and ably met and exposed by Augus-
tine, who flourished at the same period, being born In the same year, and
who, on account of the zeal and eloquence with which he supported Evan-
gelical truth, was emphatically called, ⁴ The Doetor of Grace.' The he-
resy, however, made a rapid progress after Augustine's death3 and, under
one modification or another, it is still widely operative in the visible
Church, to the present day3 opposing the most important truths of the
Gospel, and destructive of vital religion in the beart. lt would be well for
every one, who is not alive to the effects of this error, to examine into the
nature and tendency of it; and to reflect on the aptitude of the human
heart, through love of self, and· pride of intellect, to receive and maintain
its doctrinal theory. For a satisfactory elucidation thereof, the Reader is
referred to the Dissertation on the Death of Christ, appended to the second
volume of this work; in the opening chapter of which our excellent Expo-
sitor has given an extended view of the subject.
