tance ; and he encourages them to do so by his own exam-
ple. But Aquinas here seems to imagine that certain pe-
nanoes had been iinposed upon this incestuous person for
the satisfaction of divine justice, which Paul by his autho-
rity had relaxed 3 which is altogether foreign to the plain
sense of the passage.
