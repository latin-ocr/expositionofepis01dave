3. We are instructed by whom we are to be formed
again to the image of God which we have lost3 viz. through
this perfect and essential image of God, whom God sent

tion, and owing to his being encouraged, and his heresy espoused by Euse-
bius, Bishop of Nicomedia, and by the sister of the Emperor Constantine,
it soon spread. But there were too many in that age valiant for the truth,
for adherence to which the Church had undergone ten persecutions; and such
a resistance was made by those who knew the truth as it isin Jesus, to an er-
ror so awful as the denial of the supreme and co-eternal Godhead of Christ,
that a Council was speedily convened—thefirstgeneral Council of the Chris-
tian Church, viz. that of Nice; at which 318 Bishops, from all parts where
Christianity had been established, were assembled, with numerous Presbyters
and others, to the number, it is said, ofabove 2000 persons. At this Coun-
cil the anti-Christian doctrine was condemned, and that Creed drawn up,
which, something enlarged and confirmed at another Council about fifty
years afterwards, is held by the Church of England to this day3 and in
which it is the glory of a fallen sinner believing in Christ for salvationi, to
confess Him the Redeemer and Saviour, the Son of the living God, one
with the Father, co-equal and co·eternal; and the Hcly Ghost as the au-
thor and giver of life-The opinions of those who rejected this faith, once
delivered to the saints, have undergone material changes since Arius's time.
The two Socini, theological speculators in the sixteenth century, were the
chief agents in these mutations3 and since their emendations, Christ is
held to be, by the followers of men of such superior wisdom, information,
discernment, and ralionality, not what even Arius taught—⁴< the first and
most glorious production of creative power, who, though he had a begin-
ning, existed before, superior to all other creatures, and the instrument by
whose subordinate agency the universe was formed ;’' but he is sunk in dig.
nity and worth to a mere peccable creature, without any existence before his
birth of the Virgin, or other prer'ogative besides the excellence of his mo-
ral character, and his mission from the Father3 so far does one fundamen-
tal error lead to another; those who adopt the first lie generally proceeding
further, and raising up other sects that are still more remote from the truth.
“ The radical mistake,¹' as a modern writer of great utility on the subject
hasjustly observed, “ in all these systems, whether heretical or orthodox,
“ proceeds from the disposition, so natural in man, of being wise above what
“ is written. They are not satisfied with believinga plain declaration of the
“ Saviour, ⁶ Ι and my Father are one.' They undertake, with the utmost
“ presumption and folly, to explain in what manner the Father and the
0‘ Son are one3 but man might as well attempt to take up the ocean in the
‘⁶ hollow of his hand as endeavour, by his narrow understanding, to com-
⁸‘ prehend the manner of the Divine existence.'’ The great work of Bishop
Bull, ‘³ Defensio Fidei Nicaenae,'' upon which his renown permanently restS,
remains a tower of strength upon this point. Bishop Horsley's tracts dis-
persed the shadows of Dr. l‘riestley’s raising. But, perhaps, to those who
would have the summary ef the early opinions concisely, but decidedly, ex*
