the trmlz concerning God, because tlzey would lcnow it, not from

God, but each for himself*

Three properties of impostors may, therefore, be ob·

served in this place.

1. In Divine things to have confidence in the acuteness
of their reason, and to think that they can find out the
mysteries of religion by the light of nature. This was the
fault of the antient heretics, this is the fault of the Papists,
who in matters of Religion and saith hold as many dogmas
derived from human reason, as from the Scriptures.

2. To love these inventions of their own brain with a
certain foolish self-complacency, and to exhibit, like apes,
this most deformed offspring of their own conceit, for the
highest and fairest wisdom. This was the custom of all
heretics, who despised, in comparison of these their inven-
tions, the doctrines clearly delivered in the Scriptures, as
things placed before their feet.

3. Not only to love and to extol these doctrines spring-
ing from their fleshly mind, but, moreover‚ to be so puffed
up as to account these their dreams for the revelations of
the Holy Spirit himself. They, therefore, imagine, that
they are filled with the spirit, when they are inflated and
puffed up with empty wind. I might confirm all these
things by exaniples from the antient heretics3 but it is not
needful to repeat old things: consider the Papists‚ who in
all those points which they thrust upon Christian people
without the authority of the word, blush not to usurp that
affirmation of the Apostles, It seemed good to the Holy spirit

’¹ Athenagoras 2-This Author was an Athenian Philosopher of the second
century. Removing from Athens to Alexandria, he was there converted to
Christianity, and some time aiterwards made master of the Christian Cate-
chetical School in that city, and became equally remarkable for his zeal for
Christianity‚ as forhis great learning; both which are apparent from the
Apology above-mentioned, which he addressed to the Emperor Aurelius and
his son Commodus. He distinguished himself also by another work upon
the Resurrection. These pieces are written in a style truly Classical, and
have been several times printed together: the last and best edition is that
of Deehair‚ in Greek and Latin, with the Notes of various Crstics, pub-
lished at Oxford, in 1706.—Clement of Alexandria and Pantaenus were
among the Scholars of Athenagoras.
