Ver. 3. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 361

being adopted, which would have all these treasures in the
mystery of Christ to be understood olgjectively, we hence
derive these instructions :

1. He is truly wise, who has learnt the Gospel; he is
altogether unwise who seeks saving knowledge elsewhere
for here are all treasures.

2. He who places secular knowledge, and the things of
the world, before this study and sacred knowledge, prefers
rubbish to treasure: for the mystery of the Gospel is trea-
sure; all else is dung aud dross.

3. It is not to be wondered at that almost all the world
errs both in saith and practice. They err, in things to be

whom are hid all the treasures qf' wisdom and knowledge, we
have followed that opinion which explains them objecta-elis,
respecting that perfect knowledge which we have in the
true knowledge of Christ. But because (as was before
said) these words are explained by some, of that perfect
wisdom which Christ hath in himself SttlgjectiveZy, we will
discuss their interpretation and opinion. and refute their
erroneous inferences. But both the Schoolmen, as well as
the Ubiquitarians, follow this opinion: for from this pas-
sage both conclude that omniscience is an attribute of
Christ, even in regard to his human nature. But the
Schoolmen, although they differ from our Divines ve7·b(1ls[y,
