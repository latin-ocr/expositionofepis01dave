the sins of the whole world, because the death of Christ
was the death of God, the blood of Christ, the blood of
God: Therefore from the infinite dignity of his person, the
price of his blood and his flesh which he offered for us was
infinite. So Cyril, De recta fide ad Regin. lib. 2, JfGod
incestuale am] suffering in his own person be understood, every
creature is trg'fling in comparison of lzim, and the death (ff his
one body srgffices jor the redemption of the world&

Thus, then, satisfaction has been made to God and our
sins expiated. Now we must shew how the shedding of
the blood of Christ, not only hath reconciled God to us,
but also utterly destroyed the power of the devil: for from
him hath this bloody death of Christ delivered us.

Now to understand this, in the first place it must be ad-
mitted, that the power of the devil over man was upheld
by the sin of man. For if we suppose that man is free
from sin, then by no pretext of right whatever could the
devil exercise any power over him. When, therefore, the
devil attacked Christ our Saviour who was free from sin,
and by his satellites, the Jews, put him to a most painful
and ignominious death, he lost, by the judgment of God

patiently by him, God adjudged to him power over the
devil, and over all that he had possessed, so that he might
take from him the spoil at his pleasure, and rescue out of

⁸ Cyril, Patriareh of Alexandria, the writer here cited, flourished in the
fifth century, and “ distinguished himself by his zeal against Nestorius,
Bishop of Constantinople3 who, in some of his homilies, had asserted, that
the Virgin lWary ought not to be called the Mother of God. The dispute
at first proved unfavourable to Cyril, whose opinion was not only condemn-
ed, but himself deprived of his Bishopric and thrown into prison. But he
was soon after released, and gained a complete victory over Nestorius ; who,
in 431, was deposed from his See of Constantinople. Cyril returned to his
See at Alexandria, where he died in 444· He also wrote against Theodorus
of Mopsuestia, Diodorus of Tarsus, and Julian the Apostate. He com-
posed Commentaries on St. John's Gospel, and wrote several other books.
His works were published in Greek and Latin, in 1638, in 6 vols. foli‹›.''
