1 Liris or BISHOP DAVENAN'r.

A distinguished Nonconformist, Dr. Ε. Calamy, in the Memoirs
of his own Life, recently published, gives an account of a conver-
sation which he had with Bishop Burnet, who particularly re-
quested to know the opinion of the Dissenters upon his explana-
tion of the seventeenth Article in his “ Exposition of the Thirty-
nine Articles.''——“ I told his Lordship,'’ says Dr. C. “ that as for
those whom his Lordship particularly inquired after, though they
were very thankful to his Lordship for his pains, and for his
charity to those of different sentiments; yet, on the head of Pre-
destination, which he had so laboured, they could not but be
surprised to find that, when he had been at such pains nicely to
state the two extremes, he should quite overlook the middle way,
where truth commonly lies. He told me, that the true reason of
that waS, because he could not see how that called the middle
way differed from one of the extremes. Ι freely told him this
seemed more strange to several among us, because the learned
DAVENANT‚ one of his Lordship's predecessors in the See of
Sarum, had not only vigorously asserted and defended that
middle way in the Synod of Dort, in opposition to Remonstrants
and Supralapsarians, but had also been at no small pains to sup-
port it in several of his writings ; of which his Lordship took not
the least notice. This led into a pretty close discourse of two
hours' length, in which his Lordship endeavoured to convince me,
that such as declared for the middle way, must at last, when
pressed‚ fall into the Arminian scheme ε while I, on the contrary,
asserted, and endeavoured to prove, that such as were in that
way of thinking, were no more obliged to fall in with the Remon-
strants than with the rigid Predeterminants.’‘ (Vol. i. p. 276.)

In 1703, Dr. Calamy, preaching in the lecture-room at Salter’s
Hall, discoursed from the text Rom. ix. 16, “ So thenit is notos
him that wineth? διο. and afterwards published his discourse, at
the request of the airditors, under the title “ Divine Mercy exalte&
or Free Grace z'n its glory:'' in the preface to which, he com-
plains, that “ Some have given themselves a liberty to res-lect on
their brethren who adhere to the suffrages of the British Divines
in the Synod of Dort ;'’ and recommends those ‘⁶ that would see
the doctrine of particular election maintained, consistently with a
general love of God to the world, to consult the learned and
peaceable Bishop Davenant's ‘ Animadversions upon Hoard’s
Treatise ,·' a book not valued according to its worth.'’
