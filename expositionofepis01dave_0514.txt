428 AN EXPOSl'rlON OF ετ. PAUL's chaph.

vants of this our Lord Jesus Christ. Whether, therefore,
we consider the angels in reference to Christ, or in refer·
ence to ourselves, from either consideration the doctrine of
the false Apostles is overturned. For they taught, l. That
angels are to be worshipped3 2. That by them access to
(iod is opened for us3 3, That by them we derive spiritual
blessings.

l. Now, that the angels are not to be worshipped, is
evident from their relation to Christ: because worship is
due to God alone3 but the angels are not only inferior to
God, but even to Christ as man, inasmuch as he is the Head
and Lord of all angels. Hence, Heb. i. 6, it is said, When
he bringeth in the first-begonem into the world, he sailh, And
let all the angels worship him. Hence we perceive that the
angels are nothing more than creatores, although lofty and
noble3 But the catholic Clzurclz directs that God alone is to
he w07·shipped; it advises us that no creature is to be worship-
ped‚· says Augustin, De morib. Eccl. lib. l. cap. 30.

2. Hence also it is inserted, that the angels are not
mediators between God and the human rece z For if Christ
be the Head of angels, then they cannot invade the office
of Christ, nor make themselves equal to him in this respect.
But there is one Mediator between God and men, the vum
Christ Jesus: who is the Head, not the colleague of angels.

3. Whereas the angels are, under Christ the head, united'
to the rest of the Church, we readily understand that sa-
ving grace, and those excellent gifts of saith, of love, and
the like, are not impressed upon human souls by the power
of angels, but of Christ himself. For the more noble
members do not impert a vital stream to the inferior ones;
but the head emits sense and motion equally to these as to
the other.

All these things will be equally evident, if we consider
the relation of angels to ourselves. For they are our breth-
ren, and fellow-servants3 they are members of one and the
same Church3 because the same Christ is the head both of
men and angels.

1. If, then, they are our fellow-servants, and members
of the Church together with us, they are not to be worship-
