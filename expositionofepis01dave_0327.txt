Ver. 20. EPISTLE To THE cotossmNs. 241

the office of reconciliation assigned to him by God the
Father: By Him, and by Him alone, it hath, pleased God to
reconcile all things to himself.

5. Now let us consider, fifthly, how Christ hath recon-
ciled us to the Father: Havz'ng made peace, says the Apos-
tle, tlcrouglz the blood of leis cr055‚ i. e. through the blood
shed on the cross3 or, through that bitter and bloody death
which he endured on the cross.

Two things, then, are here to be discussed ε

l. Why God willed peace and reconciliation should be
made through the blood and death of his Son3 and

2. Why by the death of the cross-

As to the death of Christ considered in itself: Some
other possible mode of redeeming mankind was not want-
ing to G0d; but no one was more congruous than this, as .
Augustine writes, De Trin. lib. 13. cap. 10. This mode
was the most consistent with respect to God, because it
accorded as well with the Divine justice as with the Divine
mercy. God shewed his justice in exacting a full satisfac-
ti0n; the death of an infinite person forinfinite guilt. He
shewed his mercy, in exacting it not from us miserable
creatures, who were incapable of paying it, but from Christ,
who could pay it. But when we say that another mode of
reconciliation was possible, we wish to be understood as
speaking of absolute possibility, as it respects the nature
of the thing itself: For if it had seemed fit to God, he
could have forgiven man all his sins without accepting any
ransom3 or he might have been content with the least
measure of suffering from Christ, although he had not
yielded himself to death. But if we regard the eternal
decree of God, concerning the deliverance of mankind by
the death ol his Son. then, upon this hypothesis of the
Divine pre-ordination, the death of Christ was necessary
to human redemption ε for it is impossible either that the
Divine fore—knowledge should be deceived, or that the
Divine decree should be changed. Hence that prayer of
Christ to the Father‚ Matth. xxvi. 42, Facher, if this cup
may not pass from me except l drink- it, tlzy will be done. The
event shewed it could not: not because it was absolutely
