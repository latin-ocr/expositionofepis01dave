tions‚ with the exception of Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester,
who, being a Papist in heart, refused to sign, on account of one
of them being directed to the suppression of Popery. The Primam,
with his characteristic impetuosity‚ thrice called out to him, “ My
lord of Gloucester‚ ladmonish you to sign.'’ Upon his persist-
ing in his refusal. he was immediately suspended; and would
have been summarily deprived, but that Eishop Davenant, with
'his accustomed judgment and knowledge, observed, that before

upon legal advice and direction: and that it was not customary for
the threefold monition of au authoritative superior to be uttered at
the same moment, but at due intervals, allowing time sor the of·-

absolute Decree for their Damnation:’' and it appears to have
been the earliest treatise in this country, in opposition to what is
called the Calvinistic opinion.† Davenant penned a reply entitled
“ Animadversions written by the Riylzt Rev. Fatlzm z'n Geel, John,
Lord Bishop of Salisbury, upon a treatz'se intituled, God's Love
to mankind.'' Why he published it no earlier than after a lapse of
eight years, we know not. It is written with all the powers of his
mind. The whole of Hoard's book is incorporated in it, and he

says, ‘- I also remember his observation on Mr. Hoard's book concerning
‘ God's love to mankind,' as the first that began to set aside the Calvinists'
