Ver. 15. EPlsTLE To THE conossmns. 179

he is the visible and manifest image of the invisible God
since his incarnation, and that with respect to ourselves,

because he represents God to us.
And to this also the Apostle seems to me to have had an

eye, inasmnch as he does not barely say, Christ is the
image of God, but 7·ch Θεὸυ ἀρροίτο”υ, of 1116 invisible God,-
where an implied antithesis is to be understood3 as though
he had said, that Christ is now become the visible image of
the invisible God. For that substantiali image of God
shone forth in Christ incarnate, and represented to us, as
in a glass, God the Father, when he shewed himself to us
in the flesh‚ as the mighty and present God, and gave us
to behold in that flesh the justice, mercy, truth, and power
of God. For in the man Christ shone forth the most bright
image of the Divine perfection: ‘O' Θεὸς ἐφανερωσθη ἐν σαρκί,
God was manifest in tlzefleslz. And Christ himself says,
John xiv. 7, 9, [fye lzad known me, ise should have known
my Father also. He that liatlz seen me 110111, seen the Fatlzer.
Here we behold the Divine wisdom and goodness, for he
who is the invisible God proposes to mankind the visible
Son and God manifest in 1116 116311, 11131 by him who is the
light, tlte way, and 1116 trutlz, we may more easily approach
to him who is invisible and incomprehensible.

From this most wise Divine appointment we gather‚ that
it is not fit for us to know God out of Christ, or, passing
by Christ, to proceed directly to God. For this kind of
knowledge 01· approach to God, would rather strike horror
into us miserable mortals defiled by sin, than afford com-
forts)g The sight of God, says Nazianzen, instils sear into
men,- because God drawing nigli to us convicts llze soal (ff ils
disease. Orat. 4. [Isa. vi. 5.]

Wherefore, in like manner as they who are unable to fix
their eyes on the blaze of the sun itself without pain, may
yet look upon its reflex image even with pleasure 3 so we
who are not able to behold the Divine Majesty in itself,
contemplate the living image of it in Christ with the high*
est Joy.
