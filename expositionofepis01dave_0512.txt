completeness consists3 let us enquire how it is obtained
and held.

In hina] We are declared to be complete notsrom him,
or by lzz'm only, but in him : that we may understand that
we have that aforesaid wisdom, righteousness, and holi-
ness, not as far as we look to Christ, as though he were
distant from us3 but as far as we are incorporated into
Christ, as far as we have Christ dwelling and abiding in us.
For although it is most certain, that all the fulness of the
Godhead and of saving grace is in Christ, so that he is
like a copious fountain whence abundance of living water
fiows, yet this is the difference between him, the spiritual
fountain, and a natural one: There is no necessity that
they who wish to drink of a fountain should enter the
fountain itself3 because, standing without that, they may
draw from thence to quench their thirst: but it is not so
with Christ, who is the fountain of grace and righteous-
ness to us, for we cannot receive of his fulness unless we
are in him. For, as the old Adam in us is the cause of
corruption and death ; so this new Adam dwelling in us is
the cause of righteousness and salvation. And it is the
same whether we affirm that Christ dwells in us, or that we
dwell in Christ3 for these are united ε John xv. 4, 5, Abide
in me, and I in you. As tlte branclz cannot bear-fruit qfitself,
except it abz'de in the vine ; ηο more can με, except με abide in
me. I am tlze vine, με are tlte branches.- lze that abz'detlz in
me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. What-
ever, therefore, men hope concerning grace, righteousness,
and sanctification, for obtaining eternal life and glory, it
will be found mere dreaming and delusion‚ if they are not
in Christ, and Christ in them. And, indeed, Christ is in
us, and we are in him, when, by the power os the spirit,
and of faith wrought in our hearts by the spirit, we are
united to this our Head, and are grafted in him as branches
in the vine. Concerning the spirit, the Apostle, Rom.
viii. 9, declares, Is any one have not tlze Spirit qs Clzrist, he
is none of his. Concerning saith, it is said, John iii. 36,
