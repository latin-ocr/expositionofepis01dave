386 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAUL’S (Jhap.ii.

tales of the Monks, about the perfectiori of the monastic
state, are mere folly3 as though the doctrine of the Gospel
had not prescribed to all the most perfect instruction as to
the attainment of life eternal, but that this had been dele-
gated to Dominio and Francis. But if in this doctrine we
are abundantly supplied with all things necessary to salva-

Hence we learn,

1. True faith does not consist with ingratitude. For-
he who, through saith, sees himself delivered from the
