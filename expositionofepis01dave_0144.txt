them that do rejoice, weeps with them tlzat weep, and finally
reckons the happiness and misery of its friends as its own.
Parisiensis well terms love the most trustwortlzy and innocent
of thieves, because it makes all the goods of its neighbour its
own, and yet talces away nothing from lzz'm. Nay out of
another's good things it finds a gift which it may present
truly acceptable to God, viz. the praising of God and giv-

2. The Apostle by his conduct reproves the envy and

jealousy of this age: in which, so far from men being wil-

found their own benefit, by envying it do but torment
themselves : for set aside envy, and what Ι lzave is thiae ; set

they must be drawn from the bottom of the hears, which,
becotning servid by prayer, is fain to celebrate the glory
and the praises of God, not for for1n’s sake, but seriously.

2. Hence also, we gather this, that the giving of thanks
for benefits received, is the most suitable introduction to
petition for new benefits, whether for ourselves or for
others. For this is Paul‘s method: he gives thanks to
God for the good bestowed on the Colossians; then he de-
