hold not the Head, because they themselves neither rightly
judge of the virtue and sufficiency of this Head, nor preach
it to others. For Christ, tlte God-man, is the Head of the
Church : If they acknowledged him lo be God, they would
seek from him alone grace and salvation3 if to be man,
they would not solicit angels or other men to intercede
with God for them3 since they have Christ our elder bro-

though, therefore, as far as words go, they concede the
name of the Head of the Church to Christ, yet they take
away from him the reality and the prerogative itself of the
Head, whilst they hope more easily to obtain mercy., grace,
righteousness, and remission of sins by the meditation of
saints or angels, than of Christ3 and, therefore, they offer
the worship of invocation to them more frequently and
more earnestly than to Christ.

that they do not hold the Head,· by which argument the
Apostle proves that they are to be rejected.

Now, if it be enquired, Why they are to be avoided who
hold not the Head, or Why it is so necessary for us to ad-
here to the Head3 the Apostle shews it from the effects
which flow from the Head, and the fruit of the same3
which are comprehended in these words,
