Ver. 25. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 297

Depart‚ for I will send tlzeefar hence anto the Gentiles. And
Rom. i. 5, We have received the Apostleslzip for obedience to
thefaitli among all ualions. Whence he says, l Tim. ii. 7,
that [τε is ordained a preaclzer, and an Apostle, and α teaclzer of
the Gentiles.

But here it may be questioned how this dispensation of
God can be said to be given to Paul towards or for the
Gentiles, and not for the Jews also, and so not for all man-
kind3 since the Apostolic office includes plenary and uni-
versal power, unbounded and unlimited. For this is as-
signed by express commands to the Apostles, Teach, all
naliorts; Preaclz the Gospel to every creature. This is re-
solved as follows ε

The Apostles were not confined by virtue of their Apos-
tolic vocation to particular districts or natious3 but as it
was very inconvenient for the same men to traverse all
countries; one undertook the management of this, and
another of that province, either by Divine intimation, or by
a private arrangement among themselves. Thus, in the
Epistle to the Galatians, ii. 7, the Gospel of the uncz‘rcumci-
sion is said to have been committed to Paul, the Gospel of the
circumcision to Peler; because Paul was employed in de-
claring the Gospel to the Gentiles, Peter to the Jews 3 and
that by a certain special appropriation from God.

But here it is necessary also to add, that this appropria-
tion, as we call it, did not at all diminish the Apostle's au-
thority, or prevent Paul's preaohing to the Jews, or Peter
to the Gentiles, if occasion should offer itself. Of Paul,
indeed, it is expressly said, that he was α chosen resse! to
bear tlze name qs God before alze Gentiles and the children of
Israel; and he taught the Hebrews by an Epistle‚ as is
commonly heldfit Nor is there any doubt but that Peter,
both at Antioch and in other places, instructed not only
the Jews, but also the Gentiles in the doctrine of the Gos-
pel. The general Apostolical power, therefore, respected
all nations alike‚ but the convenience os the Chureh re-
