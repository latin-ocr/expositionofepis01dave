Ver. 7. EPISTLE To THE COLossxANs. 107

shews that honour is due to a minister from his flock: for
Epaphras is not a minister of Christ for himself, but for
others, viz· the Colossians.

It was a true dogma of the Philosopher (Aristot. Pol.
22), that there are two properties in every thing which ex-
cite the love and care of men, τὸ ἴδιον, noh τὸ ἀγαπητόν, i. e.
it is their own, and it is beloved by them. Both of these are
found in Epaphras; τὸ ἀγαπητὸν, worthy of love, for he was
a minister of Christ, and moreover faithfu13 τὸ ἴδιον, for he
was peculiarly the minister of the Colossians. Hence
arises a useful and necessary lesson, and which can never
be sufficiently learnt by the laity.

Although a Christian people are bound to love and ho-
nour all ministers, yet each flock ought to cherish with
especial love and honour those who are set over them in
particular. So Paul, 1 Thess. v. 12, We beseechyou, breth-
ren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you
in the Lord, and admonish 4you; and to esteem them very
highly in lovefor their works' sake.

Whence it appears how defective and blamable is that
affection in many who prefer to hear, and more love, any
one rather than their own proper settled minister. If Paul
had written to men of this sort concerning any one— Who
is aminister of Christfor you, he would have excited, not
their love of'him‚ but their contempt. These are they,
who, having ilching ears, heap to themselves teachers oster
their own lusts, as the Apostle writes 2 Tim. iv. 3.

So much for the commendation of Epaphras from his
office, from his fidelity in the execution of it, and from the
peculiar design thereof‚ viz. that he was appointed to the
Colossians.
