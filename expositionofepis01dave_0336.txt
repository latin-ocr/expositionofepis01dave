260 AN ExP051T10N oF ST. PAUL’S Chap. i.

Colossians, that they were ἀπηλλοτριωμένους, alienated. There-
fore, both they and all men were united to God according
to the law of creation3 but they became aliens afterwards
by their own fault. Which refutes the foolish notion of
Valentinus concerning certain men, whom he calls men of
wood and earth, whom he imagined were alienated from
God and incapable of salvation, being evil by nature3 as
Irenaeus tells us, lib. i. cap. l. But, Isa. lix. 2, says, your
iniquities have separated belween you and your God, and your
sins leave hid hissacesrom you that lze will not hear.

And enemies.] He proceeds in his description of their
former misery : They were not only alienated from God as
to outward condition, but were enemies by internal disagree—
ment. Now they are called enemies as well in the active as
in the passive signification of the term, i. e. they hated
God as an enemy, they were hated by God as His euemies.
This tends very much to augment the misery of the Colos-
sians under that former condition: For if it be the height
of felicity to be united to God through love 3 then is it the
depth of misery to be separated from God by hostile en-
mity.

That men in the state of a corrupt nature hate God, and
therefore in this sense are his enemies, is plain from Rom.
i. 30, where among other characteristics of the heathen,
this is reckoned by the Apostle, that they are IzatersofGod.
The Saviour, John xv. 18, charges the whole world with
this crime, [f tlte world hate-you, με know tlzat it hated me
before it hated you ‚· and a little after he subjoins, He that
hatelh me hatelh my Fatlzer also.

But here it is asked‚ Since God is goodness itself, and
since it is of the nature of goodness that it be loved and
desired by all, how are men called enemies of God? and in
what sense are they said to hate God?

It is answered, first, that as the peculiarity offriends is
to lilce and dislike the same things, so that of enemies is to
like and dislike contrary things. By way of interpretation,
therefore, (as the Schoolmen say) he is accounted an ene-
my whose will is opposed to the will of another in all
things. But so is the carnal man towards God3 Rom. viii.
