intreat and implore the same from God by incessant prayer:

neither is sufficient of itself.
5. He reproves the folly of this world, in which almost

all wish for themselves and their friends, health, ric-hes,
and honours3 but grace, peace, and other spiritual good
things, they neither regard, nor think of. But Christ com-

mands us to seek first tlze kingdom of God, Matt. vi. 33.
6. He comforts the godly and faithful by shewing them

that the grace of God, and the peace of (iod they always
possess3 in comparison of which good things whatsoever
fall to the wicked are filth and refuse-onzjeam, A God
appeased, says Bernard, tranquillizes all thingS, and to behold
him at peace is to be ozerselves at peace. Bernard, in Cant.

And so far as to the blessings desired. We shall now

speak of the Authors of them, whom the Apostle desig-

nates in these words following,
From God our Fatlzer and from the Lorcl Jesus Christ. In

which words he points out both the fountain and the
channel of all grace, and he describes both by their rela-

tion to us:
From God ourFather.] The fountain of grace is God

⁴· This Bernard is termed the last of the Fathers of the Church3 he was
a Monk of the Cistertian order, and Abbot of Clairval‚ born in 1091, and
who died in 1153; after having acquired the greatest authority in the
Church of any person in his time, even surpassing that of the Pope him-
self. “ No emergency of importance in Religion occurred in which he was
not consulted as an oracle; his free censures were received with awe and
reverence in the remotest parts of Europe; and his example rendered the
new order of the Cistertians so popular, that he lived to see the foundation
of one hundred and sixty Convents, which acknowledged him as their se-
cond head.” He was equally distinguished in his controversies against va-
rious heresiarchs, and especially the famous Abelard‚ and by his successful
encouragement of the second Crusade ; for “ through his commanding elo-
quence he put in motion princes, nobles, and people throughout the Euro-
pean Continent‚’‘ and descended to the grave followed by the title of ‘ The
Great St. Bernard.’ Such sentiments⁷ however, as those quoted from his
writings by our Expositor constitute his truest greatness, and these, it
seemS‚ abound in his works, often republished in 2 vols. folio: the Paris

edition of 1690 being esteenied the best.
