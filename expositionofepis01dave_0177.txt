Ver. 6. Eris'rtn 'ro THE cotossrANs. 91

Let thy kingdom come, τ’. e. let ic come to us, because we are
not able hy any inward power of our own to go to z't.

As also in all tlze world] To the particular extension of
the Gospel to the Colossians, he adds its general diffusion
in all the world. For the Gospel is compared to the sun,
which traverses and illuminates all parts of the globe. This
light the Apostles and disciples of our Saviour spread
about. Paul himselfpreached the Gospel from Jerusalem as
far as to Illyricum; Mark, in Egypt3 Matthew, in Ethio-
pia3 Thomas, in India3 Simon Zelotes, in Britain3 and
others, elsewhere: And Ecclesiastical writers relate what
provinces each of the seventy disciples traversed in their
ν preaching. The most ancient Fathers also speak of the
Gospel as even then disseminated among the most remote
nations. We shall be content with the testimonies of Jus-

which he composed at the time on “ the trial of Spirits,'' is said to abound
with excellent rules for the detection of seigned revelations and visions, and
contributed to Bffint the canor ization of some pretended saints. An ob-

servation of his m the Protestant Confession of Augsburg' 1s worth reccid-

ing here as being in unison with the afore· cited sentiment. '1hat
Confessior‘f‘fflside Scott' s Continuation of Milner's Church History),‘ “ Ger-

son writes, that man J fill zato despair, and some even committed suicide, because
they found it zmposszble satiffactorily io obser ve tlte tradztions qs the Clzur cla, and
had heard of πο consolacionsfivm grace, and tlte righteozcsness offizitlc.” Yet
the solid learning and good sense of this man, though they had carried him
through the other official stations which he had sustained with such credit
and distinction, and his correct views of the sovereignty of divine grace
and the need ot' the Gospel here evinced, were not sufficient to raise him
much above the darkness of that period, or to carry him through what the
plain state of things indicated to his judgment as necessary. It is a burn-
ing zeal for the glory of Christ-..the welfare of his Church--and the salva-
tion of precious souls, which alone can conduct a man through the work of a
Reformer. Gerson retired to Lyons in the prime of life, probably out of
disgust at what he had witnessed in the discharge of his public functions, or
through vexation for having taken part against Jerom and Huss, raised up
in Bohemia to proclaim the kingdom of God, and revive again the conso-
lations of grace and the righteousness of saith among men. He, however,
passed some years in his retirement at liis Brother's, in picus and useful ex-
ercises, carrying his humility so far as to instruct youth at school; and died
in 1429, aged 66. He wrote several works, which have been justly va-
lued, and have passed through various editions. ‘⁶ The Imitation of

Christ,” passing under the name of Thomas a Kempis‚ has been attributed
to him.
