Ver. ll. EPISTLE To THE coLossrANs. 137

by this his glorious power, than if he continued to be yet
present upon the earth in the body, and stood by each one
of us.

WeAhave unfolded what, and what kind of good that
strengthening is which the Apostle intreated for the Co-
lossians3 we have explained also whence it is derived, and
by whose mediation it is conferred upon us: It remains
that we now explain what end it subserves.

Unto all patience and long-szffering with joyfitlness] He
shews the use and end of our divine strengthening and of
our spiritual fortitude, viz. that it may beget in us patience
or eadm-auce, and long-suffering; then he annexes the cha-
racteristic of Christian patience, viz. joyfulness. Let us
inquire, first, what is the nature of these virtues·

Interpreters are not sufficiently agreed what is ὐπομονη,
patience, and what μακροθυμία, long-suffering. Some refer
ὐπομονη, i. e. patience or eudurance, to those evils which are
inflicted by God3 μακροθυμιοι, to those which are laid upon
us by men. Chrysostom so distinguishes them, as to say,
that endurance is to be exercised towards those whom we
are not able to punish 3 long-suffering towards those whom
we may. He endures, therefore, who bears with equani-
mity that evil which he cannot repel : he is long-suffering,
who, being offended by an equal or an inferior, takes not
revenge though he has it in his power.

But these expositions appear to me to restrict both
words too much. It is more probable, then, that we
should say ὐπομονη, or endurwzce, respects that load and
weight of affliction visited upon us, either by God, or by
men3 (for this word is derived ἀπὸ τοῦ ὑπομένείν, which sig-
nifies to remain under a load of afflictions, and not to be
overwhelmed by their weight); but μακροθυμίαν, οι· long-sufl-
fering, respects the length and duration itself ofthe incum-
bent evil. Themfore, he who is not broken either by the
deferring too long our deliverance from evil, or by the pro-
tracting too long our reinstatement in good, the same hath
thi‘s loszg-szfferirzg, because his mind duly extends its view
to the end which is far distant. (Tit. ii. 33 2 Pet. iii. 123
Jude, 21).
