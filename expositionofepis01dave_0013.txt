‘HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY

’ KING WILLIAM IV.

SiaE,

IT is a cause of joy to your grateful subjects
to behold your Majesty uniformly evincing a lively
interest in, and attention to, whatever is adapted to '
promote the welfare and increase the happiness of
your subjects. ,ΗΕΓ Majesty the Queen, your Royal
Consort, also proves herself a help-meet indeed in
all that can second your beneficent aims—can render
your Court exemplary in character, beneficial in
influence‚ and attractive to the virtuOUS, the pa-
triotic, and the good—and can secure to you both
the affections of your subjects, and the protection
and blessing of heaven.

Sire, it is the operation and the love of true
Religion, with obedience to that Righteousness
which is its essence, that exalts a nation—-ennobles
its princes—and will be the saseguard of them and
their people. That Religion and Righteousness
were never elucidated, at large, in a human compo-
sition, with greater excellence of manner, or power
of argument, than in the Volumes here presented
to your Majesty's approbation ; the matter of which
was put forth two centuries ago in the Latin lan-

guage, ancl has never before been published in
English.
