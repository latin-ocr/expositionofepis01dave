be the end of our action, i. e. of our affection ancl love:
And this is allowed3 because a less good is lawfully made
subordinate to a greater, as to its end ς yet the enjoyment
itself of God at horne is a greater good than faith or the

love of God by the way3 therefore faith and love are law·
fully subordinate to that as to the end.

Even some Fathers are quoted against this opinion.
Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom.4, asserts, that a good and
perfect man does uo good, either through thefear (ff punishment,
or because (ffthe hope of reward, whether from metz, or from God
himself. Bernard, in his book De amore Dei, is cited by
Durandus in support of this opinion, Though God cannot be
loved without reward, nevertheless he is uot to be served with a
view to the reward.

The same answer may be given to both3'viz. that the-
reward ought not to be regarded as the only, or even as

to be regarded as an end subordinate to that: for we aim
at the reward of blessedness, that we may love God more
securely and ardently for ever.

These objections being answered, the truth must be es—
tablished by reasons drawn from Scripture.

Scriptures, it is lawful to do; but the saints had respect to
this reward, and it is recited to their praise. David in Ps.
cxix. 112, says, I have inclined my hcart to perform thy sta-

have loolsed to the recompence of reward, ἀπέβλεπεν εις
μισθαποδοσιοιν. Paul to the Philips. iii. 14, Ipress towards
the marlefor theprc'ze of the high calling.

2. Right reason directs the agent to regard the end of
his action: for it is of the nature of an end that it should
be aimed at, and from the desire of it excite the doer to

'¹‘ Davenant follows the Vulgate, which is propter retributionem, and ad-
mits of a sense apparently more accordant with the tenor of the argument,
though that of our version is the primary meaning: the version of Tremel-
