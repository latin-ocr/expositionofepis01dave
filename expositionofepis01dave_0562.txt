476 AN EXPoslTION oF εν. PAUL's Chapii.

3. Since Christ hath obtained this splendid victory by
dying upon the cmss, this glorious effect of the cross
ought ever to be revolved in our mind against the scandal
of the oross. For it was heretofore objected by the hea-

enemies of the cross of Christ, for they seem to wish to re-
store their kingdom unto those whom Christ spoiled on the
cross-
