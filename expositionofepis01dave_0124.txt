because it is os the nature osfaz'th, that α man should be cer-

he believes this, as lte believes other things wln'clc lte does believe,

also writes, He that hatbfaith is as certain that lle ΙιαίΙι it, as

this reason3 Because every state of tlze intellect itself is the
proximate cause of its own recognition, since its very essence
exists in tbe mind‚† It may be confirmed by many testimo-

* Durandus: one of the most learned Lawyers of his time, who flou-
rished in the thirteenth century, and whom Davenant often quotes. He
was a pupil of the celebrated Henry de Suza, after quitting whom, and
taking his Doctor's degree, he taught Canon law at Bologna and Modena,
and published a famous work entitled “ Speculum Juris,” which gained him
the surname of “ Speculator.'' Being introduced by his former Tutor,
now Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, at the Court of Rome, he was employed by
Clement IV. and four succeeding Pontiffs, in important and honourable
charges· Among other posts of distinction assigned him, he was made
lMaster of the sacred palace. The person holding this office was ‘⁶ a kind
of Domestic Chaplain, or preacher of the Pope.” A part of his jurisdic-
tion in this capacity “ referred to the printing of books, and the power of
prohibiting them-'⁹ Of this office Mr. RIendham has given a full and in-
teresting account in his valuable work on the “ Literary Policy of the
Church of Rome,” Ch. i. pp. 11-13. In the progress of his preferments
and honours, Durandus was created Bishop of Mende, and employed as
Legate to Gregory at the Council of Lyons. Being recalled to Rome, he
was afterwards created Mai-quis of Ancona, and then Count of Romagna,
which provinces he governed during the tumults of the Guelph and Ghibel-
line factions. The ‘⁶ Rationale Divinorum Officiorum'’ is, however, the
best known of his works, and has been the most frequently reprinted. It is
a detailed view of the rites and worship of the Roman Church, and con-
tains a competent portion of fable. He died at Rome in 1296.

† On account of its ambiguity and the difficulty of translating this pas-
sage, the original extract is here adduced : ‘⁶ Quia omnis habitus intellec-
tivae partis, ex hoc quod per essentiam suam in mente consistit, est princi-
pium proximum suae cognitionis.’' Recogninon seems to the Translator to
be the sense of “ cogniti& in this place, as including the mind's assent and
confession of its own perceptionS. In the verses subjoined 1 Cor. ii. 12,
and 2 Cor. xiii. 5, we may observe the nicety of the Apostle's expressi0n;
in the first stadam, simple perception; and iu the second επιγινωσιιετε,
the acknowledgmcnt of this perception.
