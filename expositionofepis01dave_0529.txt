Ver. 12. EP15TLE 'ro 'rna COLOsslANS. 443

1. A Christian living in sin and serving his lusts, is a
horrible sight, nay, is deemed a monster before God. For
the dead to walk or move is plainly aprodigy: Buta Chris-
tian either is, or ought to be, not only dead, but buried,
as to the old man.

2. A Christian growing torpid in indolence, i. e. not
bearing the fruits of righteousness, nor aiming at newness

ther accuse God nor the inefficacy of baptism3 but them-
selves, who resist·the Spirit3 whom, if they would obey,
sin would be weakened in them daily‚ the image of rigb-
teousness would be renewed, and, finally, that would be
accomplished in reality which in baptism was done sacra-
mentally.

And thus far concerning the two effects of baptism3
namely‚ our spiritual burial and resurrection.- It remains
that we enquire into the cause and fountain of these bene·
fits: which the Apostle briefly indicated in these particles,
Witlz him, In whom.

We are said to be buried with Christ in baptism, and also
to have risen in Christ, or by Christ, that we may not attri-
