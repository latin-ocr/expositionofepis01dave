Ver. 1. EPISTLE To THE COLossmNs. 17

Peter than the Roman Biskop.
2. They argue, the Church is one body, and hath one

head on earth besides Christ ε but any other head on earth
besides the Pope is assigned by no one; therefore he is
the head and sovereign of the whole Church. And that it
has a head on earth, he (Bellarmin) proves from those
words, l Cor. xii. 21. The liead cannot sats to theseet I leave
ηο need asyma,- but Christ can say this3 therefore there is
a head in the Church besides Christ.

I answer3 Although the Church be one body, and mili-
tant here in earth, yet no necessity obliges us to confess
any earthly head of the whole Churcl13 because Christ, -
who is ascended into heaven, is also in the world by his
spirit, and qulckens and rules the whole Church3 but he
forms particular churches, and governs them by particular
prelates and ministers. The plea‚ however, which he brings
from the Scripture is futile and childish: for the Apostle
means not by tlze head and the feet, the Pope and the
Church3 but by tlte lzead, any man in the church endowed
with eminent gifts3 by thefeet, any humble or inferior per—
son. This will readily appear if we weigh the scope of the
passage. For he is not cautioning Peter against lording it
over the Church3 but he is warning those who were distin-
guished by spiritual gifts among the Corinthians, against
despising their inferiors ; as Chrysostom, Ambrose, and

Aquinas explain itffi

naries, is still extant. Yet this erudite man, notwithstanding the bold ad-
mission also above made, in order to sustain the Papacy set up the notion of
a running sense of Scriptum, which might be suited to the various occasions
of the Church, and adaptecl to every new rite. Vide Dr. W'right's Sermou
at salter-'s Hau, in 1734-5, ou “ Scripture and Tradition.'’

³⁸⁵ Though the champions for the Papacy in former ages of comparative
darkness might think to iinpose upon the ignorant and unxvary by such ‘⁸ fu-
tile and childish'' modes, as even Bellarmin for want of better could employ
in the plea here refuted ; yet in these (lays one would hardly imagine they
would have the effrontery to risk it. However, in 1810, a Roman Catholic
Priest in Lancashire, sent forth two octavo volumes of “ Sermons ;'' and in
one of them, in support of Papal Supremacy, revived an old gloss upon
