therefore, is the image of the Father, not of the Godhead.
The person of the Son bears the likeness of the person of
the Father3 but the Essence 01· Divine nature in the Son
is altogether the same as in the Father: I and my Father
are one. Christ therefore cannot be the same in person with
Him of whom he is the image3 but there is no reason why
he may not be the same in essence.

It may again be asked, Why is the term image appro-
priated to Christ, since the Holy Spirit also is of the same
essence with God the Father?

To this we answer, Not because he lacks the reality of
the Divine nature; for the Spirit is also of the same es-
sence with the Father and the Son: but because the spirit
proceeds by mode of the will, the Son by mode of the
nature 3 and because he proceeds not from the Father alone,
but likewise from the Son 3 but an image ought to be the
representation of one definite person.-—These things being
explained, let us now deduce some observations from this
declaration of the Apostle, Christ is the image (ff God.

Observe, 1. The error of Arius is disproved, who denied
that Christ is of the same essence with the Father: for if
he is the image of the Father’s person, he is co—essential
with the Father3 because a creature cannot be the eternal
image of the Creator, but only after the image, through the
communication of free endowments.

2. The contrary error of sabellius is also refuted‚ who
affirmed that the Son is the same with the Father, nor to
be personally distinguished from him: but nothing can be
more manifest, than that an image is something distinct
from that of which it is the image. There is the Father3
and there is also the Son, because the image of the Father
is the Sonflss

'¹‘ WVhen the numerous express declarations of Scripture respecting the
person of the Saviour are borne in mind, and when the almost unanimous
testimonies of the early Fathers are called to recollection, it seems marvel-
lous that such errors, as those aboveunentioned, should ever have occurred ;
especially among men professing to take the word of God for their guide-
Arius‚ the celebrated propagator of the heresy first adverted to, arose in
the beginning of the fourth century. He was a man of family and educa-
