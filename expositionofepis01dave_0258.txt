Who is the image of the ἱπῗυῐεῗύἰεὸίῖοᾱ, thefirst-born. of every

cr( atur-e.

In the three foregoing verses we are told of the benefit
of redemption itself. In these four which follow we have
an accurate delineation of the Redeemer. And the Apos-
tle introduces this excellent personal description of Christ
that it may more evidently appear with what security we
can repose all our hopes of salvation in such a Redeemer3
and that all other methods of salvation foisted in by sedu-
cers ought to be rejected as most palpable fabies.

Now the Redeemer is described by a threefold relation :

l. By his internal relation to God3 he is his image.

2. By his external relation to the creature formed3 he
is thefirss-born of creation, its Creator and Preserver.

3. By his relation to the creature renewed, that is to
say, to the Church ε for he is the Head—the origin, &c.

Who is the image (f the invisible God.] The Apostle
commences the description of the Redeemer, from his in-
terna] relation to God. And here we have to consider
three particulars:

l. How many things enter into the consideration of an
image, i. e. what is considered to constitute an image.

2. What sort of an image of God, Christ is, or in what
sense he is called tlte image (gf God.

cated ι the ill usage which he received from the Ecclesiastics of the Church
of Rome occasioned his becoming a Montanist; and whether he was ever
reconciled to their communion is uncertain. He lost hereby the title of
saint ‚· but, as Dr. Jortin has well observed, Charity bids ηε suppose that he
lost not what is infinitely more important. Besides his writings before no-
ticed, he composed and published many other books and tracts, on various
subjects of divinity and matters of controversy of his time, to the amount,
it is said, of 50. But for further and ample particulars respecting his writ-
ings, opinions, and character, the Reader may refer for satisfaction to
Bishop Kaye's “ Ecclesiastical History of the second and third centuries,
illustrated from Tertullian.”
