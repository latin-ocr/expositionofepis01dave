Ver. 26. EPlSTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS. 307

has a right either to conceal the Gospel, or to force new
mysteries of salvation in its place.

To lzc's saints] The Apostle in these words points out to
whom the Gospel was manifested.

Now some understand the word saints to mean those
whom God decreed to be consecrated in Christ Jesus, i. e.
the elect. Others restrict its meaning to the Apostles, the
Evangelists, and such like, gifted with the spirit of pro-
phecy3 to whom God directly manifested this mystery, that
they might be his Ministers in revealing the same to all
the world ε They suppose that these are called saints by way
of eminence. If we adopt the first sense and interpreta-
tion, we must not apply it to every kind of revelation, hut
only to that which is effectuaL and brings salvation home.
to the hearts of the hearers3 which produces not a mere
knowledge of Christ, but, at the same time, a real trust in
Christ thus known. For in this way was the Gospel mani-
fested to the saints alone, according to the words of Isaiah,
liii. 1, l‘Vlzo halle believed our repert, aud to whom leath the
arm of tlze Lord been revealed? Which words are accor-
dant with that declaration of the Saviour, Matth. xiii. ll,
To you z't is given to know the mysteries ofdze kingdom of laea-
ven, buc to them it is not given. To hear, indeed, is given
and granted to 311; but to know unto salvation, is given
only to the saints and the elect. Hence we may deduce

two points of doctrine :
l. It is no disparagement to the dignity or the truth of

God, that the numbers of those who really believe, and in
their hearts embrace the truth, is small3 for though, like
seed, it is sown universally, yet it strikes root only in the
hearts of the elect, in which the Holy Spirit powerfully
operates. For all men liare 1101 saith, 2 Thess. iii. 2. But
1’] any man be qf God, he hearetla God's words, John viii. 47;
because he himself opens the hearts of the elect, that tlzey
give heed to the Gospel, Acts xvi. 14. Gregory says, Unless
tlze Holy Spiric be in tlte hear-t (ff the hearer, useless are the
words of tlte preacher. And in the same strain Augustine
remarks, fllany hear, hut chose only are persuaded to whom
God speaks isacardly.
