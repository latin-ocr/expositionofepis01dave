‘¹' Pope Leo Ι. surnamed the Great; elected Bishop of Rome in 440, and
deservedly reckoned among the Fathers of the Church. He is allowed on
all hands to have been a man of great energy of character, and of decided
piety; and very strenuous for the authority of his See. He did not, how-
ever, claim for it that supremacy over others which was subsequently as-
sumed ; yet it was not a little enhanced in its pretensions by the great res-
pect paid to his personal merits. Soon after his elevation his episcopal zeal
was called into action against the Manichaeans‚ who, fleeing from those pro-
vinces in Africa which were at that time ravaged by the Vandals, repaired
to Rome in great numbers, and soon insected many with their strange doc-
trine, and corrupted others with their more strange practices. And it is-
worthy of remark, that in opposing their idolatrous worship of the sun as
the throne of God's power, and the moon as the seat of his wisdom, Leo
was led to aim at suppressing the custom that had long obtained among the
Christians, of turning to the east when they prayed. He alleged two rea-
sons why the custom should be suppressed, and both deserving of particular
notice : the first, because men may easily pass from worshipping God in the
sun, to worship the sun itself; for he supposes some, who in his time used
to kneel down to the sun, to have paid that respect, not to the sun, but to
God in the brightest work of his hands. The second reason he alleged is,
because it is a wicked profanation of the worship of the true God to use the
same ceremonies in worshipping him, that are used by the Pagans, when
they worship their idols. By the first of these reasons, as Bower in his life
of Leo, has justly observed, images ought to be banished from all places of
worship, at least for the sake of the gross and ignorant vulgar, who may
easily, and commonly do, pass from the worshipping of God, or our Sa-
viour, in an image or statue, to worship the image or statue itself; and it
may safely be said, that among the Roman Catholics there is scarce one in a
thousand, who does not immediately address 111 1115 prayers the image itself,
which is rank idolatry. ssy Leo's second reason, the far greater part of the
ceremonies used at present by the Church ofRome, are evidently condemn-
ed, as a wicked profanation of the worship of the true God ς since most of
them have been borrowed of the Pagans, as is notorious, and has been de·
monstrated by Dr. Middleton, in his ‘⁶ Eoeact Confhrrm‘ly betzcveen Popery and
Pagauism,‘' and more recently in Gray's “ Connection qs sacred ami Classical
Literature.” By Leo’s exertions some of the Manichaeans abjured their er·
rors, and having first performed the due penance, were received by him into
the church. Against those who continued obstinate the imperial laws were
put into execution, and they were condemned to perpetual banislnnent.
They deserved, says Leo, a more severe punishment3 but to punish them
more severely was repugnant to the spirit of the Church, and to that 191111)-
