CORRIGEN DA ET EMENDATA.

*—

In the course of inspecting the Sheets previous to their being done up, a
few typographical errors in single letters have been observed, which it was
difficult to detect in the proofs, especially in the Greek sentences 3 as, for
instance, ε· for ς, in two or three places, and mostly at the end of a word ι
these the observing and learned Reader will correct for himself.

Page 93, line 22, for access ‘mags be had, διο. read, access to the Gospel is -
open to all nations.

Page 95, the passage from Tertullian about the middle ought to read thus,
When we have believed the Gospel, we require nothing farther; for we have befbre-
hand believed, that there is not any thing which it is our duty sarlher to believe.-
Mr. Craig has given a paraphrastic version of this passage, in conjunction
with another, in his “ Refutation,’' which may throw light on the quota-
tion, obscure in itself: ‘⁶ When we have believed the Gospel, there is
nothing further necessary to be believed; because from it we know every
thing necessary to be known. This being the rule of saith which brings
salvation, we have no further article, except that there is nothing further
to be believed.”--The passage of Tertullian is from the treatise De Prae-
script. Haeret. cap. 7, the last words of the Chapter.
