42 AN EXPOSITION oF ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

I answer‚ that no one can say this: neither are any clean
from indwelling sin, as Bellarmin fancies3 but this does
not forbid the assurance of the remission of sins and of a
state of grace. For Paul acknowledges indwelling sin3
and yet believes that he was freed from condemnation‚ and
from the imputation thereos, Rom. vii. Therefore though
his argument may be good with the Papists‚ who place
their hope in works and inherent righteousness ς yet it is
frivolous among the orthodOX, who seek justification from
saith and grace, not from the law and their own righteous-
ness.

2. No man lcnoweth whether he is worthy of love or haered,
but all things are held doubtful as to thefuture. Eccl. ix. l.

For the version I contend not with our adversaries. It
is clear that Solomon spake of the judgment which is
formed from external events3 for he subjoins, because there
isone event to the righteous and to the wiched, ver. 2. He
does not therefore deny that the godly may be certain,
through saith, of the favour of God, but by events. Which
exposition Bernard approves, who says, that saith here
comesto our help, and νευραῖς to our hearts that we are the
children of God, as we have before shewn.

3. Concerm'ug propitiation be not without sear, to add sin
vnto sin: And say not His mercy is great ; he will be pacffied
sor the multitude of my sins. Ecclesiasticus v. 5, 6. This
place strangely galls the heretics.

Perhaps it does gall heretics, but it does notin the least
affect the orthodox3 for it leads to no conclusion against
the assurance of remission. In the first place, because the
passage may be understood of those who thought that their
sins were taken away by the expiatory sacrifices, although
they continued in the intention of sinning‚ and added sins
to sins daily: such people as these who without true con·
version of heart, thought their sins were expiated by vic-
tims, it does direct to be not without jem· of thezr sin being
propitiated, or (as it is in the original) of the propitiation of
their sin. And this exposition those words following con-
firm, (ver. 7) Thou shalt not clelay to turn to the Lord;for
suddenly leis wrath shall conzeforlh, &c. But we may allow
