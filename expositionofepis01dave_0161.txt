Ver. 4. EPISTLE To THE cotossmss. 75

5. Well spake Lactantius, Wlmc we give to our relatives
through qffection, we should give to strangers from philan-
thropy. It is a saying of a Grecian poet, 'leat agoodman,
{f lte qbound in riches, is a common treasure. The Scripture
in many places enjoins that enemies should be loved: Do
good to them tlzat Izate you, Matth. v. 44 3 and Rom. xii. 10,
{f thine enemy hunger, seed him; Whence that saying of
Tertullian to Scapula, Itis the custom qf all to love their
friends ,· but ic is the peculim-icy qf Christians to love their
enemim* And this especially points out the power and

² Scapula, the President and Proconsul of Africa; to whom Tertullian
wrote in consequence of his improper conduct towards the Christians in his
Province‚ pleading their cause in as admirable an address as he had before
composed in their behalf under the persecution of the Emperor Severus.
The Romish Church, prefessing the Religion of Jesus Christ, yet seems to
have always retained the character of her Pagan ancestors, and not content
with retaining abarbarous hostility towards her enemies in principle, has
ever evinced the same towards those, partakers indeed of faith and love,
but unable to comply with her superstitious. Hence her principle and
conduct towards all those, whom she deems heretics, is hatred, persecution,
and—if possible-exterminatiom and she has ever gloried in the effects,
the more appalling they have been to humanity. For historic evidence of
this, let the Reader look into ‘⁶ Townsend's Aceusations,” p. 248. In ad.
dition to the statements there given of the exulting commemoration of the
massacre of St. Bartholomew's day, the writer may add, on the testimony
ofa friend before referred to, p. 13,who recently visited Rome, and communi-
cated the fact to him, that two scene-s of that massacre were painted in
Fresco by the famous Vasari, on the walls of a noble chamber in the Va-
tican ! One is the murder of Coligny. The figures are of the natural size,
and the scientific painter has fully represented the horrors of the scene.
This chamber forms the communication between the Pauline and Sistine
Chapels, where the great mysteries of the Roman Catholic Church are ce-
lebrated by the Pope in person 3 and when the Pontiff carries ⁶ the body of
Christ' every Easter, from one to the other, he passes within two yards of
the representation of the dead body of Coligny, preserved as a triumph of
Holy Mother Church ῐ ! -

As facts of this kind are often most disingenuously deuied, when it is
supposed proos is not at haud, the following confirmation must be deemed
decisive and important by all who would not abjure common sense. It is
the spontaneous and express testimony of the Jesuit Bonanni, in his
Numis Pont. Rornae 1699, Toni. 1, under Greg. XIII. p. 336, where he
is describing the notorious medal struck on the occasion Hucono'rronurr
STRAGEs. He not only particularly relates the pubIIc rejoicings which
then took place at Rome, but affin-ms with relation to the painting in the
