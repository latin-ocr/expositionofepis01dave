Lim: or BlSHOP DAVENANT. li

Onu notices of the Bishop's connexions must be very concise.
He was one of many children. His elder brother, Edward‚ was
a Merchanu.; but is spoken of by Aubrey “ as an incomparable
man ;’' a profound scholar, and a great mathematician. His Son,
Dr. Edward Davenant, of whom Aubrey gives a long account,
was promoted by his Uncle to the Vicarage of Gillingham, Dorset,
and the Archdeaconry of Berks‚ which he resigned for tlte Trea-
surership of the Cathedral of Salisbury. He was pronounced by
Sir Christopher Wren to be the greatest Mathematician of his age.
He died in 1679, having been Vicar of Gillingham 53 years. He
had one Son, Ralph, who was Rector of Whitechapel, London;
and another, John, who was Fellow of Oriel College, Oxon; and
also a daughter, Anne, who married W. Ettrick, Esq. of Wim-
borne3 and another, Catharine, married to Dr. Lamplugh‚ Abp.
of York. In the Bishop‘s will, 116 names three other of his broz

married to Thomas Fuller, Rector of Aldwincle, Northampton-
shire, and was mother to the admirable Author of ⁴⁴ Worthies of

His appointment to a Bishopric was frustrated, at the Restora-

Sarum, to which he was consecrated in July, 1619, and died
May the 15th following3 leaving a family os fifteen children,
poorly provided for3 he is spoken of as a very hospitable and
disinterested man. To his family, our Bishop, who succeeded
him, was a father. His widow resided in the palace to the day
of her death, having, as her epitaph records, found with him
“ consolation and a home.” Of this numerous family, it is very
remarkable, that two of the daughters married divines who were
also successively Bishops of Salisbury3 the See occupied by
their Father and Uncle: Ellen being married to Bishop Henchman,
author of the “ Gentleman’s Calling,'’ and one of the numerous
persons to whom the ‘⁶ leole‘Duty of Man·’ has been aseribed;
and Mary to Bishop Hyde, a Cousin of the Lord Chancellor
Clarendon‚ and whose lineal descendant, by the female line, is
the present Sir William Parker, Bai-ta his daughter, Margaret,
having married Sir Henry Parker, Bart.; a third daughter, Mar-
