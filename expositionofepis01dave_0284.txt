198 ΑΝ EXPOSiTION or ST. PAUL’S Chal). i.

Moses, God created the heaven, meaning thereby, both hea-
ven itself and all those blessed existences which that hea-
ven contains ;

1. Because the angels are parts of the universe: but
if they had been created apert, before this visible world,
they must be totally distinct from the order of material
creatures, and of themselves have constituted a distinct
intelligible universe.

2. Because Moses expressly states, In the beginning

Gocl created the heaven and the earth ; i. e. both those bo-
dies and every thing else which heaven and earth contain:
In the beginning, viz. of time or mention, as Lyranus cor-
rectly expounds it.ge Therefore angels were not created
before that beginning. This, however, is more plainly as-
serted, Exod. xx. ll, In six days tlte Lorcl made heaven (md
earth, and all that in them is .· and therefore also the angels.
WVhence the Schoolmen affirm (Aquin De creat. art. 18),

³¹ Lyranus, 01· Nicholas de Lyra, so called froin the place of his nativity‚
Lyre, a small town in Normandy. He was descended from Jewish parents,
but embracing Christianity, entered among the Franciscans at Verneuil, in
1291. Havingreniained there some time, he was sent to Paris, where he
applied with the greatest diligence to his studies, and was admitted to the
degree of Ductor. He was author of “ Postills,'' or a Compendiuin of the
whole ssible, which occupied him seven years in accomplishing. The Rev.
James sinith, a man of considerable learning, first educated for the Romish
Priesthood, at Lisbon, but who afterwards became a Protestant Clergyman,
ln a valuable work published by him in 1777 on “ The Errors of the Church
of Rome‚'' says, that Lyra “ was one of the most celebrated Commenta-
tors on the Scripture of the fourteenth century.’' “ It is no inconsiderable
praise that, by the general soundness andjustness oi his expositions, he at-
tracted the admiration, and contributed, probably, in some measure, to the in-
struction of Luther, and of his great co-adjutors in the work of Reforma-
tion.’' Luther said of him, in reference to his work, “ Ego Lyranum ideo
amo, et inter optimos pono: quod ubique diligenter retinet et persequitur
historiam, quanquam auctoritate patruni se vinci patitur, et nonnunquam
eorum exemplo deflectit ᾗ proprietate sententiae ad ineptas allegorias.” The
best edition of Lyra's Commentary is that of Antwerp, 1634, in six vols.
folio: it is also found in the Biblia Maxima, edited by Father De la Haye,
in 19 vols. folio. Lyra was also the author of Moralia, or Bloral Commen-
taries upon the Scriptures.'’

guided him, vide Conybeare's Bampton Lectures for 1824, pp. alo-215,
