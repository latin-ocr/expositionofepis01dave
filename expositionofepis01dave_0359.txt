Ver. 24. nrisTLE To THE corossrANs. 273

So Christ himself exclaims from heaven, Acis ix. 4, Saul!
Saul ! why persecutest tlzozc ‘me ,9 The afflictions of the
godly, therefore, are called the afflictions of Christ, by
reason of his union and joint sufferings with them.

Now then let us enquire, Why the Apostle not only as-
cribes his sufferings to Christ, but also adds, that he him-
self filled up that which was behind (ff the afflictions of Christ
in his body.

And first of all, we must beware of inferring from hence
that the passion of Christ was imperfect, or that any thing
was wanting in it for the full liberation of the human race,
and satist-action for their sins. For the whole volume of
Scripture declares the contrary. He was womededfor our
lransgressimas ; and by his bruising we are lzealed, Isa. liii. 5.
By one ‹fferz'ng (gfhimselj he lzallrfor ever perfected them that Ι
are sanctified, Heb. X. 14. As far, therefore, as satisfaction
for sins is concerned, there is no deficiency in the passion
of Christ.

OE'herefore, that we may clearly understand this subject,
we must know that God not only decreed by his eternal
counsel what sufferings Christ on his part should in his
body undergo for the redemption of the Church3 but also
what each member of the Church should in his flesh be
subject to for the name of Christ: But both these suffer-
ings, as well of the Head as ot' the members (as we have
already shewn), are called tlte suffbrz'ngs cf Christ, and
make up, as it were, one body of sufferings ; with this dis-
tinction, however, that he suffered for the redemption of
the Church, which sufferings of his may be called
«προτερημοὶῑα tlze preceding szgfferings: we suffer on other ac-
counts, and our sufferings should be called ὑστερηματα, tlze
succeediug szfferings: for we do but slightly taste of that
cup ofafflictions‚ which Christ first drank deeply of and com-
mended to us. But all his sufferings he submitted to for
the atonement of sins3 we are subjected to them for other

reasons.

Any Christian, therefore, may be said tofill up that which
remains oftlze szgfferings <ff Christ, when he takes up the
cross of Christ and bears patiently those afflictions which
