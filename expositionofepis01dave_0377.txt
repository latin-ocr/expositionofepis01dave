Ver. 25. EpisrLE rro THE COLOSSIANS. 291

that Paul suffered those afflictions for the Church, that he
might thereby continually instruct the Church‚ not that he
might make satisfaction for the sins of its faithful members.

But* let us leave these Papists to their dreams about hu-
man merits, and their delusions of Papal indulgenceS‚ and
return to the explanation of the contexte*

Verse 25.
Of which CHURCH I am made a minister according to the
dispensation (ff God whiclz is given to mesor ,you cosul-

fil the word of God.

‘This verse is a continuation of the foregoing one, in
which the Apostle professed the state of mind in which he
endured the afflictions laid on him for preaching the Gos-

¹¹ 'l'he Translator cannot refrain from adding, in this place, a few remarks
to what were made at page 285, on Indulgent-es. The subject is the finest of
all those connected with the system, for illustrating one regular Canon in
the logIc of Romanism—that of assuming that the same word signifies the
same thing in the primitive, and in the modern papal use of it; or, in the
present instance, that the relaoeation of canonical pezzanee, as existing to the
third century and onwards, is the same thing as—a treasury of merIts con-
tributed by the Redeemer and the saints, and at the disposal of the Pope—
the release of human souls a poena et culpa—the remission of sins, full,
fuller, and fullest—pardons, in particular, for tens, hundreds, and thou*
sands ofyears—all ofthem facts, not denied, but explained away, by Roman-
ists who know their own religion, and who have some conscience remaining.
Proof enough is in readiness to be produced for all these points; and of the
millenary pardons, the brass tablet in the Chapel of St. Michael, Mac-cles—
field, is an existiiig testimony. But perhaps the most satisfactory is de-
rived from the unwilling admission of R. CHALLONER, Bp. of Debra, and
V. A. in his “ Catlzolic Christian ‘instruereris' ἃς. 1788. At page 117, he
writes of these elongated Indulgences, “ And thus, if it be true that there
ever were any Grants of Jndnlgences of a thousand years, or more, they are
to be understood with relation to the punishment corresponding to the sins,
which, according to the Penitential Canons, would have required a thousand
or more years of penance'‘-—“ as by their sins they (the sinners) had incur-
red a Debt oi Punishment proportionate to so long a time of Penance, these
Indulgenees of so many yearS, if ever granted (which some call in questIOn)
