AN EXPOSlTION or ST. PAUL’S Claap. i. -

And he is before all tliz'thgsse:¹ {152⁶} 7by him all things consist.

The Apostle in this place dignifies Christ with two pre-
rogatives: He is before every creature3 and is, as it were,
the foundation and support of all creatures.

The point of priority has been explained and proved
above3 for we have shewn that Christ was beo otten of God
and that the world was made by Christ: each of which
proves that he has the precedency of all creatuies, as well
in dignity as in time. For he whom God begat, must of
necessity be both co-eternal and co-essential with God.
All other things, as Aquinas properly observes, are such as
God was pleased to malce thena but the Son is suclz as God
lzimseff is. Now he who made the world must have existed
before the world: for he rnade it by imparting existence to
that which had no existence previous to its being created.
From these two considerations therefore, both that he was
begotten of God, and that the world was made by him, it
is proved that lle is before all things.

This declaration of the Apostle clearly refutes those who
deny Christ to have had a personal existence, ὑφιστάμενον, be-
fore his incarnation. For how could he have been before
all things if he was not before his incarnation? How could
he frame all things who was not himself in existence?
Tertullian, in Praxiam, says, He who came fortlcfrom so
great an essence, and made such great existences, could not but
himself have α personal existence*

³* Tertullian against Praxeas :-“ The scliisms and commotions that arose
in the Cliurch, from a mixture oi* the Oriental and Egyptian Philosophy
with the Christian Religion, were, in the second century, increased by those
Grecian Philosophers, who embraced the doctrine of Christ. The Christian
doctrine, concerning the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the two natures
united in our blessed Saviour‚ were, by no means, reconcileable with the
tenets of the Sages and Doctors of Greece; who, therefore, endeavoured to
explain them in such a manner as to render them comprehensible. Praxeas
