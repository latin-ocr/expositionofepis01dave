242 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL'S clami.

impossible, but because God had deereed from eternity,
that the benefit of our redemption should arise from the
passion and death of Christ; which decree it was impos-
sible to abrogate.

But even as to us, Divines are used to adduce many rea-
sons to prove that this mode of redeeming mankind by the
death of Christ was most congruOUS. And, in the first place,
they lay down this principle, That any mode is more suit-
able and adapted to the attainment of any end, in propor-
tion as there is in it a greater concurrence of expedients
to that end. This being admitted, it is easy to shew that
in this mode of redemption by the death of Christ, many

3. By this death of Christ, an example of righteous·
ness, humility. obedience, patience, and of all virtues, is
set before us. For the godly rejoice to suffer for righteous-
ness sake, when they reflect that Christ Jesus, the Captain
and Author of their salvation, underwent death itself. For
as it is honourable of the soldier to drink of that cup
which his general had tasted before him ; so is it to Chris-
tians, to taste of that cup of affliction which Christ him-
self drank of for them. Therefore this mode was. most
