86 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

wo teaclzer within, all our babbling is in vain. There are cer-
tain outward assistant teochers and admonitions ; lle who teaclz-
etlz tlte beart bath lzis seat in heaven& So the Apostle to the
Hebrews iv. 2, The word preached did voc profit them, not
being mixed eoitlzfaitlz in them that heard it.

Therefore God himself is the Creator of saith and hope
in the hearts of men : but the hearing the word of God is
the instrumental cause 3 as well because it shews the ob-
ject and proposes it to the mind of the person believing or
hoping3 as because those habits of saith and hope are not
imparted to sleepers, or to those occupied any other way,
but to hearers of the word of God, and to those meditat-
ing in the same3 on which account the word is called the
ministration of the Spirit, 2 Cor. iii. 8. Contemners of the
word are void of the hope of salvation.——Tl1us much con-
cerning the general instrument, viz, tlze word of God-

lerouglr the word of tlte trutlz of the Gospel] Now he
declares in particular whence the hope of eternal life
springs. For the divine word is not adapted in every part
to produce hope3 nay the law serves to arouse fear. Hope,
therefore, arises, not froin the preaching of the legal co-
venant, This do ancl tlzou shall live,· but from the promulga-
tion of the evangelical covenant, Belz'eve‚ and thou skalt be
saved. Well spake Tertullian, advers. Marc. iii. cap. 16,
T he possession of eternal life comes not to us through the disci-
pline of the law, but through* the grace of llze Gospel. As the
possession is through grace, not through the law, so the
hope of the possession is excited through the preaching of
the grace of the gospel, not of the doctrine of the law.
They who expect eternal life from the covenant of works,
do not hope, but presume. But it has been shewn before
by us, that the proper object of faith and hope, is, not all
those things in general which are delivered in the word, but
the promises of grace: it is not necessary therefore to take
up more time in explanation or proof of this matter.
