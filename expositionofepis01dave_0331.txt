Ver. 20. EpisTLE To 'run cotossiANs. 245

supposes Christ to have reconciled the things which are in
earth and which are in heaven. But this interpretation does
not remove the difficulty. For although it be true that the
angels became more kind towards us from the period when
we were redeerned by Christ3 yet the Apostle does not
speak of that in this passage3 buthe manifestly speaks of
a reconciliation of earthly and of heavenly things which is
made to God, not which is effected between themselves:
It pleased him to reconcile to himself, Sto.

Others, by alt things which are in heaven, understand all
the faithful who died before Christ's passion; and by the
all things whnh are in earth, all the rest of the faithful.
But it is not at all likely that the Apostle regarded men
alone: for he would then have said, “stre τούς ἐπὶ ’τνῖς wis.
ἐπε, τούς εν τοῖς ὀυρανὸις, whether they be persons in earth or in hea-⁸
ven ; and would have used παντας, all persons, not vraha, all
things.

The Apostle, therefore, seems in this distribution to have
intended to comprise divers objects, viz. men and angels;
nay, the whole fabric of the heavenly and earthly creation;
all which in their proper measure participate in this benefit
of redemption3 according to that expression of this same
Apostle‚ Ephes i. lO, where he says, That God pnrposed in
the dispensotion os the fnlness oftimes, ἀναιιεφαλαιωσασθαι to ga-
ther together in one, or to renew all things in Christ, hotlz which
are in heaven and which are in earth.

When, therefore, the Apostle says, that it pleased God
to reconcile all things to himself, as well things in heaven, as
things in earth, by the blood of Christ, we say this reconcilia-
tion, taken strictly, refers to men alone. For since to re-
concile is to renew a friendship broken off by offence, we
alone, from among his enennies, are restored unto the love
and favour of God, which we had lost by sinning. If we
understand it for effectnal reconciliation‚ it regards the elect
alone, who constitute, as it were. a community: as says
Ambrose, De voc. gent. i. 3, Among the elect there is α cer-
tain special nniversalz'ty to be rechoned. But if we may un-
derstand it aizalogically, it may be extended to thc blessed
angels themselves, and to all creatures.
