332 AN Exposi'rioN or ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

by afflictions, do not think upon patience, but seek re-
venge. And here it will repay our trouble to consider
what a difference there is between Paul, Peter, and the
rest of the Apostles, and the Roman Pontiffs. The Apos-
tles were armed against the persecutions of tyrants by for-
titude from God, constancy of mind, and patience: but
the latter proclaim‚ that they are armed by treachery,
sword, and fire. For Bellarmin teaches, that God had not
provided all things necessary to his Church unless he had
granted power to the Pope of changing kingdoms‚ depos-
ing kings‚ and absolving subjects from the oath of allegi-
ance, if it should happen that any king should resist the
Church. God, however, is not wanting to the Church,
although he granted not to the Pope power of deposing
kings, because he has given to the Church the power and
the will to suffer for righteousness, and because by these
sufferings the religion of Christians is increased 3 accord-
ing to that remark of Tertullian, in his Apologet. cap. 50,
T lze more we are cut down hyyou, the more we increase ; for
tlze blood of Christians is tlze seed of the Charch.

Lastly, it is hence manifest that all the labour of Minis-
ters is lost, as it respects their hearers, unless the power-
ful working of Christ produce the effects in the minds of
the one as well as of the other. Paul may plant, and Apol-
los may water ; bat God giveth tlte increase, l Cor. iii. 6.
It is necessary that tlze Hol‘zs Spirit should work interuallo, that
the remedy may be effectual which is offered externally : Unless
lze is present in tlze lzearts of the hearers, the word of the speak-
er is useless, as Augustine has well said.

We have now completed the first Chapter, in which the
foundations of the whole of the Apostolic discussion are
laid down, the titles of Christ explained, and the doctrine
of our redemption by Him settled and established. In the
following Chapter the Apostle encounters those seducers
who attempted to withdraw the Colossians from Christ.

END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER.
