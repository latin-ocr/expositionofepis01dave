288 ΑΝ EXPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL²s &cap-i,

tlze Pope, unless to be (lispensed in α lawsnl manner. Cajet.
de Indulg. tract. 9. quaest. 1. But the dealing them out by
bulls is no lawful act, because it is not built upon the com-
mand of the Supreme Lord, who directed his Apostles to
dispense the merits of Christ to the faithful by preaching
the word and administering the sacraments, &c-

2. They who are reconciled to God remain still, after
the remission of their guilt, bound to make satisfaction for
the remissior] of the temporal punishment they have de-
served3 and this we see proved by many convincing exam-
ples in the Scriptures. God forgave David the crimes of
adultery and homicide, yet he adds, Because tlton lzast given
much occasion for tlte enemies of the Lorcl to blaspheme, there-
fore tlte child shall surely die, 2 Kings xii. 14, So in Numb.
xiv, I have pardoned tlte sin (ff the people: nevertlzeless not one
of llzem shall see tlte promised land. So again, after God had
forgiven David the sin of numbering the people, he never-
theless punished him by sending a pestilence to lay waste
the kingdom. From this sort of expressions the Pap1sts
conclude that the divine justice exacts satisfaction from us
for the ends of punishment, after the forgiveness of the
guilt itself; and then they add of themselves, that this
satisfaction may be fully made, not only by our own suf-
ferings and merits, but. by those which are dealt out at the
Pope's pleasure, from the common treasury.

In answer to all this3 I admit that the faithful do expe-
rience much chastisement at the hand of God, after he has
forgiven their guilt3 but Ι deny that the intention of these
chastisements is to satisfy divine justice. Although God
absolves all true penitents from all satisfaction by punish-
ment, for the sake of Christ’s death, yet he does not ex-
cuse them from all salutary and chastening visitations.
There is then a fallacy in the consequence, when the Papists
draw this inference—The faithful, after their sins are for-
given them, endure temporal punishments ; therefore they
endure them to satisfy the wrath of God. Another end,
therefore, being assigned, this sophism is solved. Augus-
tine specifies three purposes, viz. The exln'bitz'on (ff the nn'sety
due to sin, tlte amendment ofour sifful lives, and the necessary
