‘at large I would humbly, as it respects myself, but ear-
nestly, as it respects my Author‚ commend my performance,
trusting that it will not altogether prove unsatisfactory or
without benefit to either.

As to my Translation, it is not for me to speak further
'than to state, what seems due to myself‚ that fidelity has
been my great object3 and to this I have sacrificed style,
rather than, by giving a more engaging turn to a sentence,
lay myself open to the charge, from any quarter, of having
put a gloss upon the 'sense of the original.

Nothing further is requisite than to state, that in my
l'i'mited space for the Life, it was necessary to use
compression3 and that much more might have been added
in various parts. As some mis-statements may be cor-
rected, some misapprehensions obviated, and much pre-
judice against those who hold the views of Bishop
Davenant be removed, by the addition of documents and
incidents in connexion with the facts adduced in the
Memoir3 it is my purpose, if God permit, and it should
hereafter be deemed desirable‚ to revise, and take a more Ἴ
extended survey of the Bishop’s life and writings, the
period in which he fiourished, and the sphere in which he 1
moved. In the mean time, any communication of facts, ,
records, or sentiments, from any individual qualified to
impart what might be regarded new and important, will
be thankfully accepted, and employed in a manner, which,
it is presumed‚ will not be otherwise than grateful·-
