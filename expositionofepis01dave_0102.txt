ceded to the Roman Church, and to the Bishop of Rome,
by the ancients3 but not because‘of his being the ordinary
Pastor of the whole Church, and armed with apostolic
authority by right Divine, but on account of the sobriety‚
the consistency, and the distinguished learning of those
who, in the earliest times, were set over that Church; on
account of the dignity of the city of Rome, which was
the seat of empire3 and, lastly, as Gerson says, by the
gracious and voluntary concession of other churches.

Now let us sift a few arguments of our opponents.

l. Pellarmin, lib, 2, De Rom. Pont. cap. 12, says,
Peter had the government of the whole church committed
to him3 but some one ought to succeed therein as supreme
head by Divine right3 and this successor can be no other
than the Pope.

I answer, there is nothing solid in this argument. First,
as it regards Peter, to whom they say the government of
the whole church was committed when it was said to him
alone, John xxi. 15-17, Feed my sheep. I confess, in his
character of Apostle, the power of feeding the flock of

was said, Go, teach all nations, Matth. xxviii, l9. Secondly,
we deny that successors were appointed in this apostolic
power either to Peter or any one of the Apostles ς for not
fresh Apostles, but BishOPS, succeeded to Apostles.
Thirdly, if we allow a successor to Peter in apostolic
power, he will not be, by Divine authority, the Roman Pon-
tiff3 because no Divine authority appropriated the Roman
See to Peter. Whence even Cusa‘* does not hesitate to

Ostia in 12623 whence he derived the appellation of Ostiensis, or Hosti-
ensis; under which title he is frequently cited, and by Davenant in the lat-
ter mode of orthography.

³* Cusa was a profound Lawyer and Divine, created a Cardinal by Pope
Nicholas V. in 1448, and afterwards Bishop of Brixia. It is said that he
was the author of a Refutation of the Koran, addressed to Pius ΙΙ. and
highly esteemed as a very learned productiori. A treatise of his concerning
“ Learned Ignorance,'' in which he aimed to correct and reform the disor-

ders and abuses which the Scholastic Divines had introduced into the Semi-
