Hence spring forth various doctrines.

l. The laity themselves should not be content with an
elementary knowledge in religious matters, but ought to
press forward from easy principles to a particular and rich-
er knowledge of those things which have more difficult ex-
plications and require a deeper research. Thus the Apos-
tle to the Hebrews, vi. l, says, leerefore, leaving tlze prin-
