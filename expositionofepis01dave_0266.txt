This may suffice concerning Christ the image (gf God.

It remains that we attend to that last observation 3 viz.
why God is called invisible. And that is to be considered
either in respect of the Divine nature iu itself[absolutely],
or in the person of the Father.

Invisible] First in respect of the Divine nature consi-
dered absolutely3 because neither by the eye of the body,
nor even of the mind can it be beheld‚ whilst we sojourn
here. Ye cannot see my face, Exod. iii. 20. No man bath
seen God at any time, John i. 18. He (lwelletlz in the light
inaccessibsffl 1 Tim. vi. 16. It is impossible that we should
see God with our bodily eyes, because the act of seeing
pre-supposes a visible object: but in God there is neither
corporeal light, nor colom, nor forn13 nor, in short, any
thing that hath the nature of a visible object. VVhence
the folly of the Anthropomorphites is evident, who attri-
buted to God a human appearance, and bodily lffleaments,
not unlike our ownffi If God were such, he could not be
invisible.

But neither in this life are we able to behold the essence
of God with our mental eyes. No one lzatlz seen that fal-
mess of divim'ty which dwells in God, no one comprehends
it in his mind, says Ambrose, in Luke lib. i. cap. l. Which
will easily appear if we consider the modes of our know-
ledge whilst we are in this pilgrimage.

'⁸‘ These were a sect of ancient heretics, whose doctrine proceeded from
taking every thing spoken of God in the Scripture in a literal sense.
Locke seems to think that this prejudice is almost inherent in the mind ε 11;
was entertained by the whole sect of the Stoics, and exaniples of its influ-
ence may easily be traced, not only in the writings of many of the Fathers,
but also among modern Divines. Other writers, however, have fallen into
the opposite extreme ς and supposed that God is not only a stranger to hu-
man affections, such as pity, love, joy, &c., but that even the ideas of wis-
dom, justice, mercy, and the like, are different in the Divine mind from
what they are in our conceptione, not merely in degree, but even in kind.
This opinion was embraced by Hunie, and admitted by Archbishop King,
though on different principles of reasoning; and has latterly received the
sanction of a learned and able writer of the present day. As Socinianism
has of late assumed much of its cast from these notions and principles, there
is the greater propriety in adducing these remarks, and 111 drawing the at-

tention by them to the refutation deduced by our Expositor, and in request-
ing the consideration of the young to the first article of our Church.
