Ver. 12. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 447

possess all the other things without which the inward ef-
fects of baptism are not secured. So much concerning the
instrument of saith, “

Of the operationes God] The Apostle points out the
Author or Giver of faith3 namely, God himself. For since
the salutary efficacy of baptism depends upon faith, it is
proper that saith itself should be expected from God alone,
lest we should have some occasion of glorying in ourselves.
Hence that affirmation of the Apostle, Ephes. ii. 8, By
grace are με saved through faitlz ,· and that not of ‘yourselveae
it is the gift os God. We ought not, therefore, as the Pe-
lagians would wish‚ to allege that saith springs from the
human will; nor that it is natural, as Basilides thought,
according to the statement of Clemens, Stro‘m. 23 but as¹
Augustine has stated, that it is bestowed upon us by the
free gift of God ε for although good works are (lone by man,
yecfaitlz is wrouglzt in man, Epist. 105, ad Sixtum.

Who hatlz raised himfrom the dead] Some contend that
this clause is added by the way, to intimate that God stirs
up faith in the human heart by that same infinite power
with which he raised up Christ from the dead. For since
our hearts are dead in sins and unbelief, there is need of
the same Almighty power to quicken them which shewed
itself in the revival of Christ, as it is said in Ephes. i. 19,
20. Let us not reject this sense: But we also add this3
that the Apostle here wished to point out, as with the fin-
ger, what kind of faith he required from us 3 viz. that
whereby we believe in God, who, by his wonderful opera—
tion, raised Jesus from the dead for ourjustification, as it
is in Rom. iv. 24, 25. Therefore‚ lest our saith should
wander in any confused and indefinite speculation about
God, he, as it were, moderates this infinite object to us,
y since he would have faith not contemplate the efficacy of
God simply, but as far as it raised up Christ3 for thus it
became a saving efficacy to us.

And very suitably in this place, where he treats of saith
united with our spiritual resurrection, he directs it to look
at that power of God which raised up Christ from the
dead3 viz. for two causes, which we have before touched
