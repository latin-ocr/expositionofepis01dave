Ver. 9. EPlsTLE To 'run COLOsSlANs. 117

We must therefore always seek and labour that we may
be filled more and more with spiritual gifts.

Thus much as to the quantity.

The knowledge of his wila] In these words and the fol—
lowing the Apostle explains what are those blessings which
he desires for the Colossians, and of what kind. Abun-
dant knowledge is one blessing, επιγνωσις, i. e. knowledge
upon knowledge: a cumulation and fulness of knowledge.
But of what kind [ᾗ Not any whatever, but that which is
here described by its object and its cause, viz. the know-
ledge of the divine will flowing froin wisdom and spiritual
understanding. The knowledge of the divine will denotes the
aet with the object: Wisdom and under-standing mark the
habits infused, whence this actual and efficacious know-
ledge flows. As to the object of this knowledge, we mu'st
know that the divine will, in itself, is ofinfinite considera-
tion, and inscrutable to men: This knowledge, therefore,
must be limited and restricted to the revealed will; for
knowledge (agnitio) presupposes a manifestation of the
thing· to be known.

But now, this revealed will, the full knowledge of which
the Apostle seeks for the Colossians, is referred to two
kinds: a knowledge of the things to be believed, and of
those to be done3 or of faith‚ and new obedience. With
respect to faith, This is the will of God, that every one who
seelh the Son, and helien-eth on him, may have e'verlasting lese,

of God, even yon!- sanc-effication, thal every one should lsnow

iv. 3, 4. The knowledge, therefore, of the divine will
embraees in itself the knowledge of the Law and of the
Gospel: of the Law, which shews us the abyss of our
misery, and also proposes to the regenerate a rule of new
life3 of the Gospel, which opens to us the depths of divine
iiiercy, and also teaches the method of obtaining salvation.

passage, if no other could be produced, would of itself alone be sufficient to
crusii the foul slanders which, even at this day, continue to be discharged
by the ignorant and malevolent against a most exemplary and brutally per.
secuted community. But calumny naturally follows persecution.
