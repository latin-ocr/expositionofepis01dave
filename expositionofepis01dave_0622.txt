enjoined is good or useful, since every thought ofthe kind
takes away the merit and weight of obedience. It is also
the common opinion of the Romanist's that there ought to
be such a humility among Christians, that they should not

The able corrector of Mr. Dallas, in his history of the 0rder, has well
summed up their extensive operations. ‘⁶ The Jesuits‚” says he, p. 374,
“ had no sooner appeared, than they overran the universe with surprising
rapidity : they became the Instructors of Youth ; the Masters of Semina-
ries; the Confessors of Kings: the distributors of favours ; and the nomi-
nators to every office, civil and ecclesiastical, and sometimes even to crowns ;
in a word, the arbiters of every great event: they acquired immense wealth
in freehold estates, and in the benefices which they procul-ed for their
houses: they formed the most substantial and brilliant establislnnents; and
laid the foundations of a monarchy, calculated to resist the most powerful
princes-’'—All this was effected‚ to use the appropriate ternis of Sharon
Turner, “ through a remarkable combination of ability, enthusiasm, bene-
volence, intelligence, craft, ambition, piety, and superstition.'' Under the
semblance of vows of poverty and chastity, together with that IMPLICIT
OBEDIENCE 'ro THE CHIEF or THE ORDER, as above-mentioned by
Davenant, it has always been taught among them, that oaths might beficlsi-
fied! Their statutes, in fact, have been denounced as “ a complete code of
perfidy, immorality, and revolt ;'’ and, wherever they have gained a foot-
ing, this body has established itself as an arbitrary power over the legal and
regular authorities of the State. Loyola lived to see the diffusiori of his
Order over the greatest part of the Old and New w‹›1·lds; and its attainment
of a new spiritual empire for the Popedom, in Asia and South America es-
pecially. ln less than twenty years, owing to its lNIissionary activity, it
included twelve large provinces possessed of one hundred Colleges. Within
two centuries after, their number was found to amount to 20,000. This was
ascertained in consequence of the inquiries instituted about them owing to
the Provincial Letters of Pascal, laying open their detestable casuistry and
diabolical intrigues. In 1554, long before Pascal's time, and only fourteen
years after their establishment by Paul 111„ the Faculty of 'l'heology in
Paris, whose advice the Parliament had sought, pronounced, that “ the
“ Society, withdrawn from the obedience and submissior] due to authorities,
‘⁶ unjustly deprived both temporal and spiritual lords of their rights:
‘⁶ brought discord into every form of government, and occasioned among
“ the people many subjects of complaint, many law-suits, altercations‚
‘⁶ schisms, and jealousies ; that it appeared dangerous to all that concerned
‘⁶ the Faith; calculated to disturb the peace of the Cium-clm to overturn
“ the Monastic orders; and more fit to destroy than to build up.’‘ The
formidable body, however, proceeded in its career of iniquity, till, in 1773,
Pope Clement XIV. pronounced its extinction in a Bull dated July 21 of
that year. Since the restoration of the BIonarchy in France, the Order has
been revived‚ and in 1830, at the breaking up of the Jesuit Establishment
at Moutrouge, among their archives was found the soIIowiug statement re-
