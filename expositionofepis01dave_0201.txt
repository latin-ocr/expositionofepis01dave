Ver.9. EPiSTLE To THE cotossmxs. 115

tions, whether we seek necessary things for ourselves or
for others. For he who rashly, and without regard to the
Divine Majesty, dares to launch forth to make any peti-
tion, provokes God to indignation, not to beneficence.

2. ’ΨΘ should seek benefits from God, not coldly‚ nei-
ther for form’s sake3 but we ought to be actuated by a
clear perception and an earnest desire of those things
which we seek from God, For he who requires that with
his mouth which he disregards with his beart, does not
pray to God, but mocks him.

We have explained the cause, and the mode of the Apos-
tle’s prayer3 it now remains that we consider the sum of
the petition itself, comprehended in the words immediately
following : q

Thac με may be filled with tlte knowledge of his will, in cell
wisdom and spiritual wederstanding] Now the Apostle
begins to unfold the sum of his prayer. And here two
things are to be noted : the quantity of the blessings
sought, and their quality·

That yse may befilled] The Apostle has before shewn
that the Colossians were endowed with faith, hope, and
love, and all other spiritual gifts3 but now he asks some-
thing greater from God, viz· that they may bestlled with the
same.

It may be said, we are not able to obtain full and per—
fect knowledge, or love, or holiness, whilst we carry about
this mortal body. For so the Apostle, l Cor. xiii. 9, We
know in part, and we prophecy in part, Sec. Why, then,
does the Apostle pray that they may be filled with know-
ledge, which he himself knew could not be attained'?

I answer, there is a twofold plenitude of knowledge and
of every grace : a plenitude for the inheritance, and a ple-
nitude for the way. The plenitude of the inheritance is the
greatest measure of grace which the mind of every one is
able to contain: this is not to be had before we are intro-
duced to the state of glory. But the plenitude of the way
is the greatest measure of grace which God has determined
to impart to every one of the elect in this world 2 and this
is had by all the elect before they remove from this life.
