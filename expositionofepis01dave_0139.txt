Ver.2. EPlsTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 53

arzdjustg‘fi'catz'otz: of the Divines of Cologne, who write in

Enchirid. Christ. institua* Thac it is necessary forjztstg'fication
that every one should assuredly believe that his sins are remit-
ted Ζώνη-οἲ Bellarmin himself3 who is forced to confess

that the hope of Christians should be most sure, as well
on the part of the will as of the understanding3 and that

by reason of a peculiar disposition only, it is accompanied
by any sear. But we have before shewu that these fears
and doubts do not take away assuranoe, but oppose it, and
at length are put to ssight by faith resisting, and eleaving
to the divine promises.

We conclude, therefore, that every true believer hath,
and believes that he hath that grace and peace of God which
’ Paul wishes for the Colossians.

* Cologne long held a conspicuous rank among the Papal cities of Ger-
many, and was noted for its University and the zeal of its Clergy. In 1536
Herman de Meurs, i-ts then Archbishop, having embraced Lu—theranism,
and adopted the Reformation in his Archiepiscopate, sent for Beucer and
Melancthon to preach in his province, assembled a Council of his B1shops

and Clergy, and drew up a new code of laws for their regulation. Probably
this Enclziridion was one of the results of their sittings on this occasion : for

the writer is informed, that in Seckendorf's Conim- de Lutheranismo ad
Iudicem 1. Hist. Schol. &c. mention is made of such a book as written in
German under the title Enchiridion Plebeii, in 8vo. The Papists in Cologne
were offended at it as containing the Lutheran doctrine, and wrote against
it. RIost likely it was translated into Latin. The Papal answer might
adopt the title of the book intended to be answered. But the above-cited
proposition, adduced as from an adversary, is hardly consistent with any
modification of Roman doctrine on the subject. Herman was deprived of
his Archbishopric in 1547, and his successor Adolphus summoned a Council
of the Bishops and Clergy, which, according to Du Pin, sat from lilarch
11, of that year, to April 6, 1549, to restore matters that had been unset-
tled, and adopt such regulations as were deemed necessary to adjust the af-
fairs of that church3 and doubtless every thing was revised which H erman
had introduced, though the Bishops and Clergy that had concurred with
him might guard against much Popish restoration. But the Translator has
not been able to trace out any thing corresponding to the work in question.
In Howell and C0·'s Catalogue for 1829, there is mentioned, under the title
Colon, Canones, &c. with Enclziridion Clzristz'anae Institutionis, appended; date
1538, and infolio .· but the latter work may have been in another firm and
date, and bound up wilh the former.
