130 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’S (MP-i·

produce every fruit, they do not answer the nature and ef-
ficacy of the seed. For the fruit ‘ff the spirit is not one
alone, but manifold3 viz. love, joy, peace, patience, long-
sqffering, goodness, benignity, and the like ; Gal. v. 22. There
are, therefore, two things to be noted in the matter of the
fruitfulness:

The first, that God does not approve of every kind of
fruitffilness, but restricts it to good worlcs. But those are
called good works which are commanded and directed by
God. They, therefore, who by their own inventions, and
a certain superstition, 'seexoepno-nela, a will-worship, attempt
to please God, arejudged not to grow fruitful, but wan-
ton. For so speaks the Psalmist, cvi. 39, They were defiled
with their own works, and went a whorz‘ng with their own in-
ventions. Wisely and piously spake Cyprian, The exercises
of rigltteousness are to be chosen not by our own will, but by
tlze will of Gal, De singul. cleric. And in Isaiah God
complains of the Jews, that they worshipped Irim by the
precepts of men, ch. xxix. 13.

The second, that fruitfulness of any one kind is not suf-
ficient, but we must be fruitful in every good work. If any
one produce the good fruit of alms deeds, and mingle with
them the impure fruits of lewdness; or if any one be con-
spicuous for chastity, and defile himself by avarice3 he
would not answer the divine will, or the Apostle‘s desire
of being fruitful in every good work : nay, he is accounted
by God bad and unclean. For who shall say that any one
is clean, who is wont to wallow even in a single sewer?
Hence the Apostle bids us abslain from all appearance of
evil, and wishes us to be sanctffied wholly ὁλοτελεῖς, wishes
spirit, soal, and body to be preserved blameless, l Thess. v.
22, 23.

And so much concerning that practical working where-
by we please God.

Increasing in the knowledge of God.] This is that other
working of those who wall< worthy of God, and study to
please him. As they are fruitful in good works as far as
respects an active life, so they increase and advance in the
knowledge of God as far as respects a contemplative life.
