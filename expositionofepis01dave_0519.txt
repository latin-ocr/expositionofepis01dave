Ver. 11. EPISTLE το THE conossrANs. 433

Verse ll.

In whom also pse are circumcised with the circumcision made

without hands, in puctz'ng eff tlze body qf the sins qf
the flesh by the circumcis-iou of Christ,

Hitherto the perfectiori of Christ having been the subject
of consideration, the Apostle taught in general that there
was no need for the additions of the seducers: Here he
withstands those particularly who irnposed the Judaical ce·-
remonies upon Christians. Now, among the Mosaic rites‚
circumcision held the primary place3 because by submit-
ting to this, men bound themselves to observe the rest,
Gal. v. 3, Ι testffy to every man that z's circumcised‚ that Ize is
a debtor to do tlze whole law. Therefore this being done
away, it follows that Christians are also delivered from all
the rest. On this account, then, he insists on circumci-
sion‚ since it is his intention to shew, and to conclude, that
all the Mosaic rites are now abrogated. And this verse is
so connected with the foregoing. that it aptly meets the
objection which those teachers of the ceremonies doubtless
urged. For the Apostle had affirmed in the preceding
verse, that Christians are complete in Chris& ‘ But, nay‚’
says some Jewish doctor, ‘ you are mistaken, Paul, and
you would endeavour to mislead Christians: they are not
yet complete, because they are not yet circumcised: and
without circumcision they are not accounted the holy peo-
ple of God, they are not received into the covenant which
was entered into with Abraham and his posterity.' There-
fore that he might crush this objection, after that he had
stated that we are complete z'n Christ, he subjoins, ln whom
also με are circumcised.

With respect to the interpretation of the words; those
alone seem to contain any difficulty, in patting ‘ff the body
