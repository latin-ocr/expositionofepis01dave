190 AN EXPOSVHON OF ετ. PAUL’S Chap.i.

In the beginning God crealed the heaven ancl the earth:
under which two names the whole fabric of nature is com-
prised.

Visible and invisible] This is the second division, drawn
from their qualities, which also includes all created things.
The visible things of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars3
the invisible, are the angels: The visible things upon earth
are the plants, the animals, the elements; the invisible· are
the souls of men. These, as well as all other things what-
ever, were created by Christ.

Now this statement that Christ is constituted THE Crea-
tor of the things which are il} heaven and in earth, vz'sihle and
invisible, refutes at once the foolish aberrations of many
Philosophers and heretics ε

First of the Peripatetics,²³‘< who fondly imagined that the
world must be eternal. Consequeutly they admit of no
creation‚ but lay down that there is an eternal motion in
the heavens, and an eternal succession of generation and
corruption in sublunary bodies. But they are convicted of
error, not only by the Apostle's authority, but even by
plain reason. For if motion had been eternal, time also
must have been infinite. But how then has the whole of
it passed away aud ceased to fiow, if it hath been infinite?
for what is infinite cannot pass or fiow away. If the hea-
vens have existed from eternity, then the sun has perform-
ed an infinite number of revolutions, aud an infinite num-
ber of years are gone by. But this is impossible, since
the days that have elapsed are by the known laws of pro-
portion, greater than the number of years: for no other
number greater by a certain and known proportion than
that which is infinite is admissible3 for this would of itself
evince that both were finite. As to generation and corrup-
tion, it cannot be so much as imagined to be eternal, un-
less it be granted that there is in causes either an infinite
progression or circulation. Besides, the possibility of

structions in their tenets.
