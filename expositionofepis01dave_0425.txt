Ver. l. EPISTLE To THE cotossmNs.

Hence we derive two lessons :

1. It must not be deemed boasting‚ if Ministers somen
times freely talk of the labours and toils of their ministry
among‘the people: for Paul very often did this ; it is very
proper for the people to know this3 it is done with a view
to their spiritual good.

2. They who do not know, or are unwilling to know and
acknowledge the labours, watchings, and conflicts of Mi-
nisters for their salvation, oppose themselves and their own
advantage : for from this knowledge they reap much fruit,
as was before shewn.

Thus much concerning the first point.

2. What great cotgflicc Ι bava] Ye have heard why the
Apostle wished his confliots for the Colossians to be·
known3 now, in the second place, we shall explain what
kind, and in what things that conflict consisted. Erasmus
and the ancient interpreter* translate ἀγωνα, εοίἰεὶἰιιᾱε, with
little appositeness ε for any one may be solicitous about his
own or another's affairs, although there may be no one who
opposes and resists him: but no person is said to have a
conflict except he who has strife and contention with an
adversary. Every conflict requires solicitude3 but all so-
licitude does not always pre-suppose a conflict. We, there-
fore, receive the interpretation of Beza.

But what was this conflict? with whom, and on what
account sustained ‘3

It was a conflict as well of mind as of body 3 with Satan,
with deceivers—-the members of Satan, with various kinds
of afflictions; it was undertaken for the edifying, confirm-
ing, and retaining the members of Christ in the saith.

Conflict of mind consists either in aff'ectz'om or in actions„
Contrary affections strove in the mind of the Apostle, aris-
ing from different causes. For sometimes he rejoiced and
exultecL and was full of hope, through witnessing the
faith‚ and love, and other virtues of the godly3 Rom. xvi.

³· Davenant probably means the Vulgate, for Beza translates o’c‘ycovoc
certamen, with this note, “ Vulg: et Erasmus ἀγωνα vertunt solicPtudi-

neni non satis expl'essse‘.”
