Ver. 5. EPISTLE To THE conossrANs. 85

phras. But here are two things to be noticed by us: the
instrument of producing faith and hope in general, viz. tlte
word of God heard3 in particular the word of tlze Gospel,
which is distinguished by an adjunct, viz. trzctlz.

As to what pertains to the first, the things which are
hoped for and believed by Christians‚ are placed beyond
human reach3 therefore that they may become known to
us, there is need not only of human, but of divine instruc-
tion. But the word of God is the orgari of this divine in·
struction‚ according to that appeal in Rom. x. 14, How
shall they believe in lzim qs whom they have not lzeard? and
how shall they hear without α preaclzer?

But here we must shew more explicitly in what sense
the word preached by men becomes the instrument of pro-
ducing saith aud hope, since faith and hope are free gifts·
derived immediately from the fountain of grace, Jas. i. 17.

We must know therefore, that two things concur to pro-
duce saith or hopeg a knowledge of the things to be be-
lieved or hoped for3 and the assent of the heart. This
knowledge arises from hearing the word ε for the
knowledge of salvation is not communicated to men in
these times by extraordinary revelations or inspirations3
but tlze word preached is the power of God unto salvation to all
that believe. Therefore as to the propounding and know-
ledge of the things to be believed and expected, hope and
faith depend upon hearing as a necessary instrument. But
then, as to the internal assent of the heart, whereby every
one firmly apprehends and applies the doctrine proposed
to be believed and hoped in to his own comfort, this as-
sent arises from feelings of hope and faith infused by the
internal operation of the Spirit. Therefore the doctrine of
faith and hope is promulgated by man, but the habits
of saith and hope are infused and implanted by God him-
self. Whence Clemens, Paedag. 1, Ἦμεν κατηχησις εις πίστιν
περιάγει, πίςτις δὲ αὙι’ω παῖδευέτοιι wsmari. Instruction indeed
leads to saith, hut saith z's also taught by the Holy Spirit.
And here that celebrated saying of Augustine applies.
