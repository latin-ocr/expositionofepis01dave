Ver. 23. ErlsTLE To THE cotossrANs. 265

preached among many nations‚ and to be preached in due
time to all, it is spoken of as preached then to every crea-
ture.

But they seem to me to explain this passage best, who
say, that every creature, or the whole world, is opposed to
the single Jewish nation : so that the sense will be, that the
Gospel was proposed not to the Jews alone, as the Mosaic
law was3 but also to other nations without distinction.
Therefore there is nothing else signified by this kind of
Ι expression, than (what Paul sets forth in Galat. iii. 28) that
in the Gospel there z's neither Jew nor Greek, neither hond nor
free, neither male nor-female ; but that Christ is equally of-
fered to all in the preaching of the Gospel. This Gospel
then, in the saith of which he wished the Colossians to
continue, is the same as was preached to all other peoples
But we spake of this universal extension of the Gospel
when we explained the sixth verse 3 therefore it is not ne-
cessary to add more: We only deduce from hence a few
observations.

l. We hence infer against the Papists, That it is suffi-
cient for salvation if we yield credence to that Gospel
which was openly preached to 311, although we may be ig-
norant of, and reject those doctrines, which they foist upon
the faithful under the title of tradisz'ons. For Paul clearly
teaches, that the Colossians would be holy and unblam-
able, if they continued in the faith and the hope of the
Gospel which was preached to every creature. In vain,
then, do the Papists cry out, that there are certain tradi-
tions not written, but privately committed to certain per-
fect men, to which, however, they would have the faith of
all Christians bound under the pain of anathema. Of this
character are those opinions concerning purgatory-indul-
gences-the adoration of images—-the Supremacy of the
Pope3 to which if any one does not give credit, he is put
as much beyond a state of salvation by them, as if he de-
nied altogether the fundamental articles of the faitlL But
we affirm with Tertullian, Praescript. Haeret. cap. 22, Ic is
