186 AN ΕΧΡοειΤιοΝ or· s‘r. PAUL's Chap.i.

But here two things are to be avoided: First that we do
not, from its being said that Christ is tlzefirst-born in respect
of the divine nature, infer, that this ineffable generation
took its origin from some beginning of time. Christ hath
a beginning of origin, viz. his Father of whom he is begot-
ten ε but he hath not a beginning of time3 for he is begot-
ten by the Father from eternity. Well spake Thomas,
T lze Son hath not so received from tlte Father as though receiv-
ing afterwards what he lead not before: bnt because lle lzatIz his
being from tlze Fatlter even from all eternity: according to
that Scripture, The Lord possessed me in tlze beginning (ff leis
roay, Prov. viii. 22. His goings fortlz have been a diebus
eternitate, from tlze days (f eternity, Micah v. 2. In the
beginning, John i. l. Therefore this word first, when it is
spoken concerning God, does not impute a tempor-al
beginning to God, of whom it is affirmed3 but only ex-
cludes the priority of other things: Ι am tltefirst and the
last, Rev. xxii. 13. Nor hence must we infer that God
either had a beginning or will have an end; but we must
from hence deny that any thing either existed before him,
or will continue after him. So, when Christ is called the
first—born, we are not to infer that therefore he had a tempo-
ral beginning of his existence: but we must therefore de-
ny that any thing was co-evaL or more ancient than He.

Secondly, we must be aware of inferring with the Arians,
from Christ being called tlzefirst-born of every creature,
that therefore Christ is a creature. For thus they argue ;
As the first-born of brethren is of the number of the breth-

rcspecting the history of the eventful times in which he live‹l; evincing
also, that, ‘⁶ to a capacious and powerful understanding, richly stored with
originalemnceptions and acquired knowledge, Basil united great activity‚
presence of mind, and moral courageg and was neither disheartened by dif-
ficulties, nor intimidated by dangers. 111 a variety of ardent contests, and
most trying circumsta11ceS‚ he is seen universally acquitting himself with
dignity and firmness; and even when unsuccessful, maintaining the respect-
ability of his character and station.'' The opinions of a man like this—
being founded in trum, tried by experience, and guarded by intelligence‚
learning, and principle—are to be regarded 3 and whilst the value of them
is thus evident, the propriety of our Expositor's frequent reference to him
is apparent.
