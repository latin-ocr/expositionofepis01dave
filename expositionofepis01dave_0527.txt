not even that is wanting3 nay, that Christians have a more
excellent and express sacrament than circumcision, viz.
baptism3 Buried with him in baptism.

Thre‘e things are to be noted, l. The spiritual benefits
which are received in baptism: viz. the burial of the old
man, which we usually call mortification3 the raising again
of the new man, which we term vivification. 2. From what
fountain these benefits flow, viz. from the death and re-
surrection of Christ3 which is intimated in those words,
With. lzz'm, in him, or by lzim. 3. By what instrument these
benefits are applied to us3 viz. hysaith.

Bnried in baptism] This burial of the body of sins, or
of the old Adam, is signified in baptism, when the person
to be baptised is let down into the water3 like as the re-·
surrection is when he is raised out: For in the ancient
Church they not only sprinkled‚ but immersed in the water

body of sin, then, is buried. when its power is weakened,
repressed, overwhelmed, and, as a corpse buried in the
earth, can move no more and impel the man whithersoever
it would, or hinder our salvation. And this is said to be
done in baptism in a twofold respect:

1. In respect to Christ3 in whom, when we are engraft—
ed by baptism, the benefits of the death of Christ are con-
ferred upon and sealed to us: but he being dead and bu-
ried, it is clear that our sins were also dead and buried with
him; because lae bare them in his own body, l Pet. ii. 24.
This is what is urged by the Apostle in Rom. vi. 3, As many
of us as were baptized into Christ, were baptized into his death.
In looking back, then, to the person of Christ our Head,
our sins are rightly said to be indeed dead and buried in
his death and buria13 and we are said to be buried in bap-
