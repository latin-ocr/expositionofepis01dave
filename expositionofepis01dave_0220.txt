134 AN EXPOSITION oF ST. ΡΑυιΧ»1 Chuni.

3. As a Virgin, although slze be adorned with remarkable
cleaste'ty and modesty, yet if slze pass her lq'je in tlze midst (ff
corruptors, will need assistance lest she be overcome by (heir
blandislmzenls or tkreats ; so tlte human son! adorned willa
grace and holiness, never-theless requires constant strenglllening‚
because it exisls among corrupling men and evil spirits, and
also inIn-ed lasts.

Ye see the necessity of strengthening on account of the
infirmity of the fiesh. But why does the Apostle say,
strengtlzened with ALL might?

First, to intimate that we fight not against one enemy,
neither are opposed by weapons on one side only, but by
many, and on every side. There are three chief adversa-
ries, the flesh, the world, the devil; under each of which,
as leaders, there are innumerable bands of troops. Se-
condly, to signify that it profits us little, if we conquer
any one or some of these enemies, unless we bravely tread
them all under our feet. For, as Cyprian speaks, rfavarz'ce
be overthrown, lust rises ,· iflnst be subdaed, ambilion succeeds;
if ambition z‘s spur-ned, zrratlc incenses, pride inflates, &c-
Unless we overcome these enemies one and all, we are con-
quered : There is therefore need of all might against every
kind of enemy.—-Thus much concerning the good which is
sought·

ἀυτὸυ.] This is an Hebraism 3 for the genitive case of the
substantive is put instead of an adjective, vim gloriae, i. e.
vim gloriosam, tlze power of God for glorious power. Now
in these words the Apostle shews whence the strengthen-
ing and might of the godly comes, namely, from the glo-
rious power of God. Three things are to be considered:
What this strengthening power is; Why it is called glori-
ous power; How it comes to us, and whence it is derived.
As to the first: The strengthening power is the Holy spirit
himself, with his gifts3 who breathes wonderful might into
our infirm minds. For so Christ himself speaks, Luke
xxiv. 49, Tarry με, said he to the Apostles, in tlte city of
Jerusalem, until με be endued with power from on high 3 i. e.
until the Holy spirit enter into you from heaven: For so
