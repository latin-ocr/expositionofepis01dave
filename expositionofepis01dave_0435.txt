things is most modest, in these becomes most fervent, &cz- Love
is, therefore, the fruit of unanimity in saith, which so binds
the minds of the godly, as it were, in covenant, that though
some‘light offences may intervene, yet, as the boughs of
the same tree, driven asunder by the wind, immediately
come together again because they are fixed steadily in one
and the same root3 so something similar takes place as it
regards the minds of the faithful, because they are still

i. e. while the errors aud corruptions of the chureh, which
ye acknowledge as your mother, are so many?

2, Pious Princes should endeavour in their dominions
to establish the one true religion, if they look forward to
the salvation of their subjects, or to peace and public con-
cord, however false politicians may scoff at it. For they
cannot have subjects lenit together in love, unless they have
