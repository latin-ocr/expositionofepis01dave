226 AN Exl’OSITION OF ετ. PAUL's Chap. i.

hour is coming in which all that are in their graves shall hear
the voice of the Son of Goel, and shall comesorth, διο. and l
Cor. xv. 20, Christis risen from the dead, the first-sruits of
them that slept. Why the first-fruits? Because, like as
under the law, the offering of the first-fruits was the cause
why the rest of the fruits should be blessed3 so the resur-
rection of Christ is the cause why the rest of the members
shall rise again. I am releasedfrom my death ‚· I rise again
by thepower (ff Christ, says Prudentius, in Apoth.

Lastly‚ As the exemplary cause. For the glorious resur—
rection of Christ the head, holds out to us an example of
our resurrection and future glory: He shall change our vile
body, that he ‘may ‘malfe z't lz’lce to his glorz‘ous body, Phil. iii.
21.

It is therefore evident that Christ is most deservedly dis-
tinguished with these titles by the Apostle, viz. of the be-
ginning and the first-bornfrom the dead ; as well because he
quickened himself to the life of glory, as because he
quickens all that are his, both from spiritual and corporeal
death.

Observe, l. From the circumstance of Christ being said
to beto us the beginning both of the life of grace and of
the life of glory, we conclude that they who are not united
to this beginning, are neither partakers of grace in the pre-
sent life, nor will be of glory in the life to come: but this
union is effected by saith and the Holy Spirit ε they who
are destitute of these will also be destitute of the other.

2. Since Christ is called thefirst-bornfivm the dead, we
understand that death is not now to be feared by Chris-
tians; who are entitled to expect by-and-by a certain new
and glorious resurrectional birth. For as Christ, on rising
again, is called thefirst-bornfivm the clead5 so all we, after
rising again, shall obtain a certain new nativity. He hath
begotten us again 'mzto α lively hope by the resurrection ofJesus
Christ Jrom the dead, to an inloeritance reserves! in heaven.

as spake Prudentius nisena—'rhus much respecting the
titles themselves.
