Ver. 1. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 7

you should understand what it behoves you to believe ε but
this saith is the gift of God. Thus says Augustius* Con-
fess. lib. 6. cap. 5, Thou least persuaded me, Ο God, tlzat not
those wlco have believed thy books, but those wlzo leave not be-
lieved them are to be blamed ; neither should they be listened
to, ff any by chance should say, Whence do you know these
booles· to be furnislzed to tlte human race by tlze Spirit of the

only true God?

the Gospel oftentimes to bring to mind, What office and
what station they hold in the church3 that having their
vocation continually in remembrance they may endeavour
to fulfil their duty to the utmost of their power. For he

⁴⁸⁵ Though Augustine has been already noticed, yet such readers as are -
not familiar with the anclent fathers may wish to know more of him; and
especially as it will be found that our Expositor often refers to him. A few
remarks, therefore, in addition to what was observed (page 3) may be al-
lowed here. At an early age Augustine was instructed, by his pious mother,
in the principles of Christianity3 but being a youth of great vivacity, he
was led into extreme dissipation, and gave himself to licentious pleasure
without restraint. For this, however, he afterwards made ample reparation
to society, in the most ingenuous manner, by his book of Confessions, cited
above. Moving from place to place, in the study and profession of rhetoric
and polite literature, and having taught at Carthage and Rome, his mind in
the mean while thirsting after truth, he came at length under the preaching
of St. Ambrose, at Milan3 a circumstance which led to a thorough conver-
sion at the age of 32. Soon after this his life became devoted to piety and reli-
gion3 and, says a competentjudge of his writings in the present day, “ the
humility, devotion, and uuction of this father3 the acute, lucid, and happy
way in which he meets his objectors; and the heavenly wisdom running
through his remarks, will always, notwithstanding the excess of allegorical
interpretation and the defect of a clear statement of justification, make his
writing valuable.'’ Bickersteth’s Christian Student· PerhapS, as Milner
has remarked, ‘⁶ the doctrine ofjustification was never fully and clearly ex-
hibited to the Church (after the times of the Apostles) until the days ot
Luther;'‘ yet it is somewhat remarkable that, excepting this defect, Au-
gustine has been deemed to accord mostly in doctrinal sentiments with Cal-
vin. But another critic (Mr. Conybeare, in his Bampton Lectures) has
observed, ‘⁶ he who is insensible to the beauty, the piety, and the devotion
and spiritual feeling which are to be found in almost every page of Augus-
tine's Commentary, must be, to say no more, both uncandid and fastidious.”
Augustine was ordained Bishop ot' Hippo in 395, and died in 430, aged 76.
His works form 10 vols. folio. His “ City of God,'‘ his “ Confessions and.
Meditations‚” have been translated into English.
