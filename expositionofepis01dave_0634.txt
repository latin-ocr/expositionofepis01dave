whatever by Divine right, but merely from Ecclesiastical Constitution,
founded on political reasons of State, according to the relative dignity of
the Sees in the Empire.

The words used by the Fathers are these following:

“ WVhereas the See of old Rome had been, not undeservedly, distin-
“ guished by the Fathers with certain privileges, because {hat city was the
“ seat Qf tlte Empire—the Fathers of Constantinople were induced, by the
“ same reason, to distinguish the most holy See of new Rome with equal
‘² privileges, thinking it FIT that the Ciry which they saw honoured with the
“ Emperor and Sonare, and equalled in every civil privilege with old Rome,
‘⁶ should likewise be equalled to her in Ecclesiastical matters.”

If there were no other document but this to confute the pretended su-
premacy cf the See of Rome, by D1vine right, surely this Canon of so
great a Council as (2¹30 Fathers composed, held not till the middle of the
fifth century, with the reasons alleged for its mactarent, ought, of itself,
to be sufficient. In this there is no mention made of, nor any reference to
St. Pete1·;—no allusion to any supposed dignity derivable from him ;—
every thing connected with rank, or pre-eminence, depends on civil or po-
litical considerations, because (as the Fathers allege) the two imperial cities
enjoyed equal civil rights, they should enjoy equal Ecclesiastieal privileges.
Hence it incontrovertihly follows, that in the Church of Christ, as every
thing originally was equality, whatever pre-eminence subsequently was
possessed by any particular church, or see, it was derived from a civil source;
i. e. froin human institution ; for, according to the ordinance of the Mes-
siah, all his Apostles were equ:rl; none, according to Him, was to be Mas-
ter.—Vide Craig's Ret'utation.

Cyprian's works, edited by Bishops Fell and Pearson, are among the
prohibited books in Pope Benedict's Index Expurgatorium. The reason is
obvious; those Editions contained passages which the papal Inquisitors had
blotted out, or omitted, in former editions, as standing in honest array
against the prerogatives and usurpations of Rome, and excluded such as
they had obtruded into the 'l'ext to maintain her assumed supremacy.
Those Editions were printed, in fact, from genuine copies of Cyprian’s
works; but the diffusiori of them would not suffice for that Church which
had the power of accomplishing its ends by other means.
