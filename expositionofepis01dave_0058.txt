all can wilk and that so many will not, is because they 105151
God's grace :'' adding, “ Bishop Overall was in the right, andI
am of 1115 mind.’'

Itis from this, that a supposed change in Davenant's opinion
1135 been inferi-ed. Hence Mr. ι130115011, 111 1115 able life of the
great Puritan divine ,John Goodwin (the most profound Arminian
theologian that this country has produced‚) tells us, (and Mr.
Nicholls, in the Presace to 1115 works of Arminius, repeats the. re-
mark,) that “ Bp. Davenant appears to have undergone a change
os sentiment similar to that of Baxter.''—Therc 15 110 difficulty in
refuting this3 but there is much difficulty in reconciling Baxter's
remark with the fact. Davenant's views at the Synod of Dort,
prior to his acquaintance with Usher, are distinctly stated 111 1115
“ Reasons‚'' and in many of his works: and his reply to Hoard,
just before his death, is in strict accordance viith them. He held
Universa] Redemption, as we have seen, at Dort3 but he held it
as inseparable from Reprobation, or Preterition3 and he main-
tains against Hoard the same doctrine, and the same inseparahle
Reprobation. The truth, or error, of the doctrine is, of 0011150,
1101 affected by this: but, as a matter of fact, the evidence 15 100
distinet to be doubted for a moment, that not a shadow of change
occurred in 1115 opinions. How, therefore, 10 understand Baxter's
remark I know not.

ln 1650 was published a thin folio, containing Dissertationes
Duae; prima, de Morte Clzristi; (of which a translation 15 311-
nexed to this work,) altera, De Praedestz'natione et Electione, &o ;
to which 15 appended, Sententia de Gallicana Controversia, de
gyratiosa et salutari Dei eryci homines Peccatores voluntate, &c.
These treatises, selected from our Author's papers‚ had been sent
10 Abp. Usher, by Dr. Edward Davenant, for the purpose of pub-
lication. But the wretched state of the times prevented their
appearing for some years3 and it does not seem that the Arch-
bishop was the Editor : for the preface 15 signed with the initials
T. B. The French Controversy had arisen upon the opinions of
Cameron, a divine of the Gallican Protestant Church: Davenant's
sentiments were applied sor, and are here given. At 1110 end os
this volume, but not named in the title-page, is Sententia Ecclesiae
Anylicanae de Predestinatz'one et capitibus annexis, ab eodem (ut
fertum) Authore, jussu Regis Serenissimi conscripta. How this
can be imputed 10 Dave'nant, and received as such by the Editor,
