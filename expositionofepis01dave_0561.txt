aid, as commanders are accustomed to conquer in battles3
according to what is said in the prophet Isaiah lxiii. 3, I
have trodden the wine-press alone. Thus you see how Christ,
by his death upon the cross, spoiled the devii, made a shew
of him, and finally triumphed over him most gloriously,
accomplislzing a noble triumph, as OEcumenius aptly remarks
on this passage.

But it may be asked‚ How are the daemons said to be
spoiled‚ disarmed, and led in triumph, when it appears by
the declaration of the Apostle, Ephes. vi. 12, that they are
yet exceedingly powerful to attack the faithful themselves3
fm- we wrestle even now against principalities aud powers, so
that we need the strongest armour.

I answer, they are spoiled and disarmed‘ of all power
whereby they could deprive the elect of salvation3 but
for the exercise of these, and that they also may triumph
over them after the example of their Leader, they are per-
mitted to tempt and oppose believers, but they shall never
overcome them. For he who bruz'sed Satan under his own*
feet, shall also bruise him wider ours, Rom. xvi. 20.*

We may add :

l. Since Christ hath spoiled and taken away the powers
hostile to us, we have an argument whereby afflicted con-
sciences may be comforted in the conflict: For although
the devil, sin, and our other foes, may appear to press
upon us3 yet they cannot conquer, because they are re-
strained by the authority of Christ our Leader3 they lie'
crushed and trodden under his feet.

2. We are animated, therefore, to the spiritual warfare
against these enemies, who are already overcome and
routed, nay, triumphes] over by our Captain: for those
who are vanquished are always more angry than powerful.
He, therefore, who despairs of being able to overcome the
devil and all his satellites, seems to deny the victory
of Christ, who, through his trfflmphing, causes us to
triumph. '
