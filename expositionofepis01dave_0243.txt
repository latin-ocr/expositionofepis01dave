Ver. 13. ErisTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 157

therefore, God hath delivered his people from the power
of darkness. We touch upon these points lightly now,
because all of them are to be treated again.

l. Observe for instructio'n3 that the whole world is in-
volved* in darkness under the devil, neither is there a spark
of saving light to be found in us before deliverance3 for
we are in the power of darkness ; that is to say, spiritual
darkness hath dominion over us.

2. Observe for caution; that the godly, being deliver—
ed, ought to have no fellowship with the works of dark-
ness : for they are rescued from the power of the devil and
of sin, and therefore by serving these they shew them-
selves to be deserters. Let us therefore cast off the works of
darkness, Sec. Rom. xiii. 12.

3. Observe for consolation; that although the godly
are often oppressed by tempora] calamities, yet they are
delivered from that. great misery which consists in the hor-
ror and guilt of eternal death, in comparison of which
misery, all external evils are light and trifling.

And bath translated us imo the kingdom of his deor Son]
The Apostle annexes a new benefit, which much enhances
the loving-kindness of God. For it seemed a light matter
to him to deliver us from the power of darkness, i. e. from
a condition of the deepest misery‚ unless he translated us
from thence into the kingdom, i. e. into a state of the
greatest felicity and joy.

From which conjunction of these benefits we may in-
fer-3 That there is no middle state3 but all men are either
most wretched slaves under the dominion of Satan, or
translated into the kingdom of Christ. There is no third
kingdom3 neither can the same person be a subject to
both. But let us come to the express words of the text.

There are three points to be well considered in these
words : What is the nature of this translation (² What may
be understood by the kingdom into which we are transla-
ted? Why it is called the kingdom of leis deor Son, and not
of God, or of heaven, or of light? which regard to the
contrast seems to have required.
