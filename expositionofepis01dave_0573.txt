Ver. 16. EPlSTLE To 'rna conossmrzs. 487

But here, that all superstition may be avoided, we must
apply certain cautious.

l. We must not think that there is inore of holiness in
one day than another; but must understand that, on ac-
count of the order and regulation of the Church, and for
the other reasons above-mentioned, we asseinble upon one
day rather than another for these exercises of holiness.

2. We must not think that the Christian Church is
bound by any necessity to the constant observance of holy
days3 butmust conclude that these days appointed by hu-
man authority, may be done away and changed by the same
authority if the advantage or ‘necessity of the Church
should require it: For (by the rule of law) ,Any thing may
be dissolcea' by llte causes wlziclz may originale z't, he tlzey what
they may.

3. Neither must we conclude that private Christi-ans
are bound by such necessity to the celebratior] of festivals,
but that they may omit the public solemnization of them,
if either necessity or charity require it: but let them take
heed lest, upon a false pretext of necessity or charity, they
violate the order of the Church, and abuse their Christian
liberty. Hostiensis, De feriis.

4. Although certain festival days are distinguished by
the names of Apostles or Martyrs, yet we must not think
that they are appointed for the worship of them, or are to
terminate in the honour of these. For that error ofBellar-
min is to be exploded, who, lib. 3, De cultu sanct. cap.
16, asserts that the honour of feast days immediately and
determinately pertains to the saints. The holy Fathers
judged otherwise: Eusebius, in lib 4. cap. 15, observes,
We do not worship the stlat-tyrs, but we love them asjbllowers
of Christ, of whom we also wisse to becomefollowers. Bas-il,
in Asceticis, cap. 40, says, Itis not proper that Chrisliates
should appear together in remembrcmce (fille lllartgsrs sor any
other cause ilcan ιο Ῑηάμ, and by a rchearsal (ff tlte constatior]
οἷ’ the Μαι-[9η be scir-red up to (ιη imitalion of like zeal.
These festivals, then, are referred to the remeinbrance of
the saints, by whom Christ hath edified his Church for our
own benefit3 but for the worship and honour ofGod ¹alone,
