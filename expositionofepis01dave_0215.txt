Ver. 10. amsTLE To THE conossmns. 12³9

3. As a tree lives and bears fruit, not for itself, but for
the owner, and for others to whom he sees fit to impart of
its fruits3 so a godly man ought not to live to himself
alone, nor to care only that his life be honourable to him-
self, biit that it may be especially honourable to God, who
is his Lord, and beneficial to all his brethren 3 for this is
to resemble a fruitful tree.—And thus much concerning the
fruitfulness required: It remains to speak of the matter of
this fruitfulness.

ln every good work] Behold the very broad and spa—
cious matter in which the fruitfulness of a godly man is
exercised: And truly in this he differs from a tree : For no
person seeks different fruits from one and the same tree3
but God expects that every one of the faithful and rege—
nerate should produce every kind of good works. And
the reason of this dissimilitude arises from this circum-⁵
stance, that since the fruit of any thing answers to its
seed, a tree produces only one sort of fruit, inasmuch as

the virtue and power of the seed planted is limited to one3
but the seed which is sown in the hearts of the pious (viz.

the Grace of the Holy Spirit) avails to the producing
equally of every spiritual fruit: Unless, therefore, they

had baptised, to supplant him in the See: Supported by the Emperor Theo-
dosius, he defeated his opponent, and his election was confirmed in the
Council of Constantinople‚ held in 381. 'I'he difficulties> of his situation,
however, induced him shortly after to resign it ς when he retired to his pa-
ternal estate at Nazianzum, and there lived in seclusion till 389, the period
of his decease. He was not only a man of piety, learning, and talent; but
alsoin other respects an estimable character, displaying on most occasions
more moderatim] and liberality than was usual among the Divines of his
age. As a Divine he so far outstripped the rest of his day, that “ he was
ιι entitled ’o θεολόὙος κατ’ ἐξοχηνς and a differ-enee from his doctrine was
‘⁶ identified with Heresy. A dutiful son, a faithful friend, and universally
“ beneficent, he would have been a model for society, had he not been too
“- sensitive, and, perhaps, too ascetic. Humble, though full of energy;
“ despising worldly advantages unless he could apply them to the advance-
“ ment of Religion; untainted by immorality, for-giving injurios, and in-
“ defatigable in his Ministry, he may be accounted the most exemplary,
“ as well as the most able Christian on record in the fourth century.‘’

is said to be equal to that of the most celebrated orators of ancientGreece.
