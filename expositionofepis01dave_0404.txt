:318 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’S Chap. i.

In these words, then, the Apostle marks the distinction
between his doctrine and that of false Apostles. They
were joining angels with Christ, and the works of the law
with saith, in the business of salvation: but Paul was
teaching that Christ alone was competent to fulfil every
part of the office of a Mediator and Redeemer3 and that
saith in Christ, not obedience to the law of Moses, pro-
cured our salvation. The doctrine, therefore, of this pas-
sage is this ;

That they only preach Christ aright and as they ought
to do, who teach that all hope of salvation for mankind is
laid up in him alone, and who acknowledge that we receive
the riches of divine grace through him alone. The other
Apostles also preached such a Christ: For Peter, Acts iv.
12, says thus ; There is salvation in no other ;f0r there is none
other name under heaven given among men wlzereby we must be
saved. So Paul declares, Gal. v. 4, Christ is becomecff none
effect to you, wlzosoewrof you arejustffied by tlte lazm ⁸ye are
fallen from grace.

Hence it appears that the Papists do plainly deviate from
the purity of the Gospel doctrine, who ‘unite angels and
saints with Christ in the Mediatorial office; intermix their
self-righteous works with the perfect righteousness of
Christ in the matter of justification 3 and incorporate
masses‚ indulgences, and satisfactions of their own con-
triving‚ with the blood of Christ in the work of reconcilia-
tion. He who makes Christ a sort of half-way Saviour and
Mediator, does not in fact preach him, but the chimera of
his own brain : for this is a fundamental error in the princi-
pal subject of Gospel preaching.

2. Warning every man and teaching every man in all wis-
dom] Here the Apostle proceeds to describe the manner
of his preaching, upon which we must make three obser-
vatlons.

The first is, that the ministry of the Gospel recognises
two separate offices, viz. Warning, and Teaching. The
word νουθετεῖν, which the Apostle adopts in this place, seems
to me more extensive in its meaning than the Latin word
admonendi, warning or admonishing. For it is literally‚ to
