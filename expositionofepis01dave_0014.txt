In presuming to lay before your Majesty’s sub—
jectS, in their vernacular tongue, this incomparable
Exposition of a most interesting portion of the
Word of God, to whom could the individual who
has ventured on the hardy task, under all the con-
siderations connected with it, orave permission to
dedicate this Edition, but to your Majesty‚ whom
the Providence of God has placed as a Nursing-
Father over the Church of which he is an unworthy
Minister.

Should your Majesty, and your Royal Consort,
deign to give any countenance to the performance
of one, who rests 311 his claim thereto on the unri*
valled merits and the unspeakable utility of his
Author, and who would not permit himself to aspire
to it on any lower groundS, your Majesty may, by
such condescension, be instrumental in promoting
the welfare of the Church; for your countenance
will commend to the attention of many, a work
singularly adapted to impress upon the judgment
those principles, which will be influential‚ where
reason is under any due subjection to an humble
desire to receive and obey the truth: thus will be
ensured the practice of those duties which we all
owe to God, to our Country‚ to Religion, and to
each other.

That Peace, Prosperity, and Happiness may
attend your Majesty's reign, and bless you and her
Majesty the Queen, for years to come, is the earnest

desire and prayer of, S
1RE,

Your Majesty’s most unworthy,
But devotedly faithful,
And most obedient Subject and Servant,

THE TRANSLATOR.

Bmumauffl, May l, 1831.
