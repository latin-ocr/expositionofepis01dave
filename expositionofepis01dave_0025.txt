1211*ss OF 13151101‘ DAVENANT. XV

These divines, having received their directions from his Majesty
at Newmarket, and from the Archbishop, proceeded on their
journey.

On their arrival in Holland, and first public audience, Bishop
Carleton addressed the States-General and the Prince of Orange,
in an eloquent and impressive speech, urging them to the preser-
vation of truth, and the cultivation of peace and unity. In all
the documents and histories of this Synod, it is allowed that the
British divines conducted themselves with equal talent, dignity,
and judgment. It had been strictly enjoined them before their
departure, both by the King and Archbishop Abb0t‚“ to allow of
no meddling with the doctrine or discipline of the English Church,
and to be peremptory on the point of introducing into the deci-
sions of the Synod, the Universality of Christ's Redemption. To
this they religiously adhered; and were extremely tenacious of⁴
the honour of their own Church, enforcing her moderation as a
model on these subjects. With respect to discipline there was
little difficulty. When the Belgic Confession was read, as that
which was to prove the conformity or non-conformity of the Re-
monstrants, the articles concerning Church government were ex-
pressly excluded. Nevertheless, as the thirty-third article main-
tains, that “ all ministers have equalpower and authority, because
all are equally ministers of the one only universal Bisltop and
Head of the Church? Carleton, having consulted with his Col-
leagues, entered unexpeetedly into a direct refutation of it3 ob-
serving, that the assertion was in oppositiou to the example of
Christ, and to the precedent of his age, of that of the Apostles,
and of every subsequent period ; and that the argument by which
it was defended was singularly inconclusive; for the twelve apos-
tles, and the seventy disciples were ‘⁶ all equally ministers of
Clzrz'st,’' yet the latter had not “ equal power and authority with
the. former,’' and though “ all men are equally men,'' yet. it follows
not that one man has not “ justly power and authority over
another.'' To these observations no reply was made* Upon
doctrines, the difficulty was greater. The determination of the
British deputies to have general Redemption admitted into the
decrees, or else to withdraw from the Synod, led to some heated

is called Calvinistic doctrine, with attachment to Calvinistic discipline, the
Editor not only refers his readers to pp. 374-5 of this volume for Dave-
nant's views, but has also annexed to this Memoir, a translation of Quccslio
xlii. of his Delermiuationcs, which is an admirable sunnnary of the episcopal
argument.
