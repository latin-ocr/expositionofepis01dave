422 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

perty‚ and yields subsistence to it; and thus the Word,
omnipresent in heaven, earth, and every where, sustains
the humanity existing in the heavens alone : But the actual
position of the body of Christ is included in certain space,
because the nature of a body requires it. Some illustrate
this by the example of the Suu and the solar Sphere. For
as the Sun is inseparably united to its orb, yet the property
of the sphere, to be in East and West at the same time,
does not accord to the globe of the sun 3 so the humanity
is inseparably united to the Divinity, but will not be, on
that account, wherever the Divinity is. But some perhaps
may say, that the sun is not united to his orb as a whole,
but as a part only; but humanity is united to the entire
Word. We acknowledge a dissimilarity of the similitude
in this respect3 but it tends more to confirm our opinion.
For every spiritual nature, wherever it is, is a whole3 be-
cause it is without partS, or indivisible, and its entireness
is considered in the perfectiori of its essence, not in the
extension of quantity. The Word, therefore, as sar as it
is a spiritual substance, is whole, and entirely in the hu-
man nature united to it, for it cannot be detached from it:
and the same Word, as far as it is an infinite substance, is
equally whole and entire without the human nature, for
its immensity cannot be included in such narrow limits:
But whether considered in the body united to itself‚ or out
of the human nature of Christ, it no where exists disunited
from the human nature, because every where it sustains it
as its own·
