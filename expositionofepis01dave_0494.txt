408 AN ExPOSlTlON or ετ. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

Verse 9.
For in Ιιίηι (lec-ollem all tlzesulness osllee Godlzead hoelus

In a foregoing verse you have understood the state of
the controversy, namely miss—The doctrine of Christ made
known in the Gospel is sufficient for salvati0n3 neither is
it needful to join thereto either the maxims of philosophers,
or the inventions of any men whatever, or even the Jewish
ceremonies (formerly enjoined by God himself). Paul un-
dertook to demonstrate this against the false apostles3 and
he proves it by several arguments.

The first is drawn from the perfectiori which is in Christ,
and, by consequence, in his doctrine. Now thus the case
stands : Additions are needed to supply some defect or im—
perfecti0n3 but He in whom clu-ells all the falness of the
Godlzeacl bodily, is not an impersect Mediator, Saviour, or
Teacher of the Church; therefore, in the business οι· doc-
trine of salvation we ought not to join any thing to Christ
or his doctrine. As though he had said, Perfect Deity
dwells in Christ our Saviour and Teacher, with all Divine
attributes, wisdom‚ power, mercy, διας what need is there,
then, to seek other means or helps to salvation out of
Him? Will Philosophers instruct thee better than Wis-
dom itself? Will Angels lead thee sooner to God than
Mercy itself? Will those ceremonies and legal shadovvs
justify thee better than Christ himself, the scope and ful-
filment of those ceremonies? Rest thyself in him alone,
therefore, in whom alone dwelz's all tlzefalness of tlze God-
head bode'ly.

But the better to understand the force of this argument
and also the signification of those words, because the rea-
son is drawn from the indwelliug Divinity, let us consider
these three things3 the dwelling, In lum,- the inhabitant,
all thefulness qftlze Godhead; the mode ofinhabiting, bodily.
