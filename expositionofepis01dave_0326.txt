240 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL'S Chap. i.

demption to any other than to him to whom he owed his
creation. Bernard, De passione Dom. cap. 46, gives as a
reason, Because redemption more excites us to love tlzan crea-
tion. If, therefore, we had been redeemed by any other
than he who created us, we should have loved him more
than our Creator. I even affirm, finally, that an angel
could not perform this work. For an angel owes to God
whatever he hath, and can do on his own account: he has
no superabundant merit, which he can afford to expend for
the redemption of man. But if an angel could not effect
this work of reconcffiatiou, much less could a mere man,
guilty of sin, and obnoxious to Divine wrath. For, as the
Apostle says, Ephes. ii. 3, All are by nature tlte children qf
wrath. Nay, if we could suppose any man entirely free
from sin, he nevertheless would not be a fit redeemer and
reconciler for mankind. For the redemption and reconci-
liation of the human race requires a mediator whose obe-
dience is of infinite merit, whose humility is as pleasing to
God as the pride of our first parents was displeasing. But
the obedience of any mere man, however holy, is due and
required by God3 is finite, and hatli nothing whereby it
can answer for and expiate an infinite offence. Therefore
Christ alone, the God-man, could and ought to reconcile
ns to the Father: he alone could, in respect of his Divine
nature: he ought, in respect of his human, which he as-
sumed for that very end, that he might deliver man and
bring him back to God. Whence the Church, Acts xx.
28, is said to be purchased willa tlte blood of God.

Hence we infer, that Christ alone is the bond of our
union with God3 so that, out of him, we are miserable,
because not yet reconciled to God.

Hence also we refute their error who seek reconciliation
with God either by the aid and intercession, or by the me-
rits of angels or of saints. For since Christ is called our
reconcilier, this title, even as all the former ones, is to be
understood exclusively and by way of contrast, as though
the Apostle had said, He, and no one besides him, is the
head of tlze Chare-lm He, and no one besides him, is endow
ed with afulness of grace,- He, and no one besides him, hath
