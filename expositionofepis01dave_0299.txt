Ver. 18. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 213

strument attached to the primary agent3 and so the huma-
nity of Christ is said to infuse grace and spiritual life in-
strumentally. As, therefore, it derogates not from the na-
ture of a corporeal head, because it infuses life and motion
to the ‘other members not immediately of itself, but by
means of some secret power ; so neither is it any detracm
tion from the honour of the mystical head, that it infuses
life and grace, not primarily from itself, but by means of
the indwelling Deity. Christ is, therefore, notwithstand-
ing these things, the head of the Church in each nature.

You see what kind of a head the Church has3 not God
alone, nor a mere man; but Jesus Christ, God and man.
Hence many observations arise:

l. Whereas the head of the Church is G0d‚ we inser
that the Church will abide for ever, neither shall the galas⁴
af hell prevail against ic ,· for if God be with, us who shall be
against us? A less than God would indeed have been in-
competent to the protection of the Church : for the devil,
and almost the whole world wage constant war against it.
Herein, then, is the consolation of the Church, that Christ,
tlze head of the Church, is greater to protect it, than tlze devil,
the enemy oftlze Clznrclz, is ta oppose it ; Cyprian, De exhort.

2. If the head of the Church be God, the members of
the Church ought, with all sear and reverence, to obey its
head in all things. For there is an infinite obligatior] which
binds every creature to obey its God3 but that obligation,
if possible, surpasses infinite, whereby the Church re-
deemed and sanctified, is bound to be subject to its God,
its mystical and life-giving head.

3. If the head of the Church be God, then the ascen-
sion of Christ into heaven has not deprived the Church of
its head: nay, he is present, and will be always present,
with his whole Church, by the presence and power of his
Divinity‚ although he may not appear to our eyes by his
bodily presence. This he himself promised, Matth. xxviii.

error of the advocates for the Papacy, therefore, concern-
