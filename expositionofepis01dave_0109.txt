Secondly, Whereas all of us who have been baptised are
called saints, we are admonished of our duty, which is to
SERVE Gon IN HomNEss ΑΜ) RIGHTEOUSNESS ALL
THE DAYS oF OUR LlFE. For if we are without the life
ot' saints, the name of saints will profit us nothing. Tlee
participation of names or titles, says Tertullian‚ determines
not tlee real state of things. Although therefore hypocrites
may be classed under the same denominatim] with true
saints, yet they shall not receive the same rewards from
Him who searches hearts.

Lastly‚ WVhereas we are called saints because we have
been consecrated to the service of God in baptism, it
plainly follows, that every Christian who serves the devil‚ '
the flesh, or the world, is guilty of sacrilege3 for he per-
verts vessels consecrated to God, i. e. his body and his
mind, to profane, nay to devilish uses. Well spake the
Orator, It is established by the common law of nations, that

morlals may not appropriate to their use that which is conse-

⁴· How different Roman Catholic principles are to this rule of Christianity
let the following fact determine, taken from Gauntlet's preface to his “ Lec-
tures on the Apocalypse.'‘ Speaking of the prevailing sentiments of Papists
in regard to Protestants, he says: “ Some years ago I was in the habit of
frequent intercourse with several emigrant French priests. In my conver-
sation with one of them, who subsequently held an eminent situation in a
Roman Catholic College, our discourse turned on the salvability of indivi-
duals without the pale of the Romish Church. My opponent, for such in
this point he was, strenuously argued on the negative side of the question.
ln order to bring his views to a practical bearing, and to try how far per-
sonal feeling-s might be a barrier to his creed, I remarked, ‘ Then you con-
sign me among the other heretics to eternal danmation Ρ* The substance of
the firm and consistent reply was, ⁴ I can make no exceptions3 there is no
salvation out of the Catholic Church: Illy antagonist, it will be seen, was
a genuine son of Rome—a true Papist, who was neither afraid nor ashamed
to maintain the doctrine of that anti-catholic and anti-christian Church, of
which Ιιε was a consistent and zealous minister.” Doubtless. instances of an
opposite character and sentiment exist, and the Translator could give some3
but they are rare; and, as Mr. Gauntlet well observes, those who take
more becoming views of the subject dissent in an essential point from the
§iffaltc'ble Church: they are not true Papists.
