house, and yet he says that his heart went with his ser-
vant, because he saw as clearly his act, as they who were
present when he met them. And these words, Beholdiug
your order, &c. favour this interpretation. We do not,
therefore, deny, that what was granted to the prophets‚
could have been granted to an Apostle also : since the care
of all the churches was laid upon him, it is very likely the
state of all the churches was also known to him, not only
from the vague report of men, but from the revelation of
the Divine Spirit3 to the intent that he might better con-
sult and provide for the necessities of the churches. We,
therefore, admit and unite both interpretations‚ stating that
the Apostle was with the Colossians as well in the medita- -
tion of his mind, as in the revelation of the Spirit, although
absent in body.

Joying cmd beleolde'ng] That is, joying because I behold:
for the conjunction has the force of the causal particle.
But this disposition of his mind the Apostle wished to ex-
press, lest they should suppose that he doubted their con-
stancy, inasmuch as he so earnestly excited them to perse-
verance: nay, he does this because he greatly desires that
they should continue in the same, that this his joy may
likewise continue3 like as 116 does with the Philippians‚
iv. l, My Brethren, clearly beloved‚ mys joy and crown, 50

stand fast in tlze Lord.
Ye see after what manner the mind of the Apostle, being

absent, was affected3 viz. so, that he always thought about
the Colossians, that he beheld their state, that he rej0iced
in this contemplation and observation.

Hence we infer,
1. That a faithful Minister never ought to be wholly

absent from his flock : therefore, by care, by thought, and
by prayer to God he should be present with them, when he

cannot be present in body.

2. The true joy of a minister arises from the circum-
stance that the people continue and increase in spiritual
blessings, not from the circumstance of himself being en-
riched with temporal ones.
