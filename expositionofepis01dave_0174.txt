88 AN EXPOSlTloN OF s‘r. PAUL's Chap. i.

A twofold reason may be assigned for this3 First, be-
cause what is most excellent in any kind, is wont (per an-
tonomasian'ffl to claim its generic name as by special prero-
gative. Since, therefore, among the various kinds of
truths, saving truth is more excellent than the rest3 the
doctrine of salvation is called the doctrine of the triech.
The doctrine of the law, since we are become weak
through sin, becomes a doctrine of death 3 the doctrine of
the Philosophers relates to men as citizens, not as touch-
ing their salvation3 the doctrine of the Gospel therefore
remains, which alone is saving, and therefore is alone
called, by way of eminence. the word of tlte truth, i. e.
saving truth.

Secondly, the Gospel may be called the word of tlte trutlz
because it is the word concerning Christ, who is the way,
the lise, aad the trutlz; John xiv. 6. For Christ is the
true body, in comparison with which the legal rites and
ceremonies were shadows and figures: whence that word,
T lze law was given by Moses, grace and trutlz by Jesus Christ,
John i. 17. And John viii. 31, If με continue in my word,
then are με my disciples indeed ; aud με shall know tlze trutli,
and the trutlz shall mulce youfree. Since, therefore, Christ
is the truth, and the Gospel hath Christ, both as its author
and its object, it is most aptly called the word of tlte tt'utlz.

I must not here proceed to such observations as may be
deduced from what has been hitherto advanced concerning
the instrumental cause of producing faith in particular, and
also from this title whereby the Gospel is distinguished,
being anxious to hasten forward to the verses which follow.

 

cipal features oi it being embodied in various and ample Biographical
Sketches, in works either well known or easily accessible. Though an emi-
nent promoter of the Reformation by exposing the abominations of the
Church of Rome, he had not, like Luther and Melancthon, the probity or
courage publicly to abjure her. That church, however, after his death,
which happened at Basil in 1536, repaid whatever services he might have
rendered to Religion by his ridicule of her practices, by condemning him
for a heretic. This took place in a conclave held at Rome about 1655.
