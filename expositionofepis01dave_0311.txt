Ver. 18. EPISTLE To THE COLosslANs. 225

through Jesus Christ our Lord. 3. Lastly, as the exemplary
cause3 for the resurrection of Christ is every where pro-
posed to us as a type and pattern of our spiritual resurrec-
tion : Lilce as Christ was raised up from tlte dead, so we also
should walle iu newuess of life, Rom. vi. 4.

If Christ were not in us tlze beginning of this spiritual
resurrection, there would be no hope of the blessed and
glorious resurrection, as it is written in Rev. xx. 6, Blessed
is lie wlzo lzatlz part in tlzefirst resurrection ,· on suclz tlze second
death luuh uo pomer. For the Spirit of regeneration is the
earnest of the blessed resurrection, giving the commence—
ment of spiritual life, and the right to that resurrection
which is unto life eternal. Hence Tertullian (in libro, cap.
47, De resurrectione) beautifully says, tlzat by regeneration
our bodies are inaugmatedsor this resurrection. A'nd Aquinas, -
in Epist. ad. Rom. upon those words, chap. viii. 11, If tlze
Spirit of lzim wlco raised up Jesusfrom the dead dwell inyou,
lie tlzat raised up Clzristfrom ilie dead slzall also quiclsen your
mortal bodies by tlte Spirit that dwelletlz, in ‘yozw says, Oui·
bodies slzall be quiclceued forglory on account of tlze diguity
wliiclz they liave obtained from tlte circumstance oft eir having
been tlze temptes of tlte Holy Spirit.

Thus, then, it appears that Christ is the beginning and
the cause of our spiritual resurrection by his corporeal
death and resurrection.

Now as to that corporeal resurrection which we expect3
of this also Christ is tlte hegiuuiug, in all those ways which
we have touched upon in the spiritual resurrection. 1. As
the meritorious cause: For by his passion and victory he
won for his people a glorious resurrection : He was delivered
for our offences, and was raised again for ourjtcstfficatiou,
Rom. iv. 25. But wlwm lie llatlzjustzfled, lie will glorffy,
Rom. viii. 30. leo is gone into heaven, and is ou tlze right
hand of God, 1 Pet. iii. 22.³‘= .

2. As the efficient cause: For he himself by his Divine
power will raise up all his people to glory ; John v. 28,lee

'¹' Our Author's words under this reference are, ‘⁶ Deglutiit mortem, ut
vitae aeternae haeredes efficeremur‚” which are bom-owed from the Vulgum,
and seem to be an addition to the text, as an interpretation.
