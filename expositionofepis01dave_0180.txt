94 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειτιοΝ OF ST. PAUL's Chap. i.

answer, First, that this is uncertain 3 for we learn from Ec-
clesiastical history, that the Gospel penetrated into the far-
thest coast of the Eastern India3 and the most learned men
(among whom is Arias Montanus, in libro Phalegfit) think
the Eastern parts of this India were contiguous to the
Western parts of America‚ or of the New World. Although
this also could be answered, that those regions began to be
inhabited, long after the times of the Apostles 3 yet when
the Gospel is said to have come into all the world, it is
understood into those parts of the world which were inha-
bited by men. It is now quite clear that the Gospel
was preached in all the world.-Bu.t why does the Apostle
introduce the mention of this thing in this place?

First, that he might shew the prophecies of the ancients
to have been truly fulfilled, and also of Christ the Saviour,
concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and the propaga-
tion of the Gospel. The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and
kings to the brightness of thy rising, Isa. lx. 3. The people
who wallced in darkness have seen a great light, ibid. ix. 2.
This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world,
Matth. xxiv. 14. This could not but confirm the Colos-
sians in the doctrine of the Gospel, when they understood
that it was destined for the Gentiles, by the divine decree,
from the beginning of the world.

Secondly, (as Chrysostom has observed), because persons
are confirmed in the faith from having many associates in
their tenets. For although the multitude of these who err

does not procure credit for error3 yet a multitude of per-

dura, in 1527. After studying in the University of Alcala, he took the
habit of a Benedictine‚ and attended the Council of Trent in 1562, where
he obtained considerable reputation. On his return to Spain, he retired to
a hermitage, whence he was withdrawn by Philip ΙΙ. to edite a new Poly-
glot, which he conipleted in 8 vols. folio, Antwerp, 1572. After satisfac-
torily clearing himself at Rome, from a charge of corrupting the text⁷ he
was offered a bishopric by Philip, but preferred a second retirement, from
thch he was again solicited by the king to return, and become librarian of
the Escurial. He died in 1598, aged 71- Resides the Antwerp Polyglot,
Arias, who was one of the most learned Divines of the sixteenth century,
published several other works, which are chiefly erudite Commentaries on
the Scriptures.
