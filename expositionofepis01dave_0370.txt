284 AN EXPOSVHON or ετ. PAUL’S Clmp. i.

4. W'hatever a limited agent does, if he exceeds the
bounds of his commission‚ goes for nothing: but the Pope,
in pretending to remit by his bulis, those temporal punish-
ments which divine justice requires thern to endure, ex-
ceeds the bounds of his commissi0n3 for God never dele-
gated such authority to him. Punishments of his own
imposing for discipline's sake, he may relax3 but those
which the Divine justice has determined to exact, he can-
not.

5. The Pope cannot de facto absolve any man from
those penal chastisements which God is pleased, not un-
commonly to inflict, after true repentance3 again, there-
fore, he boasts falsely of his power by bulls to free men
from the temporal punishment of their sins. For when
God has determined to chasten any man by disease of
body, death of children, or loss of property, no plenary
indulgence of the Pope can deliver him at all from these
temporal afflictions.

6. The remission of sins is fully set forth in Holy Scrip-
ture3 but this remission by means of indulgences is (as
the Papists confess) authorised neither by the Scripturcs

selle, tom. xxviii. p. 30). He was a Dominican Monk, who flourished at
the beginning of the lssth century. The date of his birth has not been as-
certained; but it is known that he embraced the Monastic life while very
young. He studied theology, civil and canon law, and geometry; and, for
some time, was a Professor at Bologna. Called to Rome to teach theology,
he was soon after nominated Master of the Sacred Palace. He was one of
the earliest writers against Luther ; but, notwithstanding the lavish com-
mendation bestowed upon his labours by most Italian Biographers, he was
not equal to contend with the great Reformer, and Leo X. prohibited Ma-
zolini from continuing to write on the points under discussion ; a principle
upon which the Roman See has often found it convenient to rest, in order
to avoid the bringing out of the whole truth. He, however, nominated
him one of Lutlier'sjmlges3 an inconsistency which was severely :mdjustly
