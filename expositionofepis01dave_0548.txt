either of the Divine knowledge, or of our own conscience.
Melancthon interprets the hand-writz‘ng to be that sentence
of condemnation which, from the decrees of the Divine
law, conscience infers against itself: for instance3 The
Divine law bath decreed, leou slzalt love God with all thy
beart: Thou skalt not cavet, διο. If thou continuest not in
these things, tlzou skalt be cursed. These are the decrees of
the law. Now conscience suggests, I have not loved God
with all my heart3 lhave coveted : therefore, Iam cursed.
He calls this conclusion, arising out of the decree of the
law, the hand-writing: he says this is blotted out, when the
law loses its power of condemning; but, as will be here-
after shewed, it loses this upon our sins being forgiven
through the death of Christ. Some modern writers under-
stand the ceremonial rites3 which they would have to be
called α ΙιαιΛ-ωνίΐὶηξ, because they were the testimonies of
human guilt: for circumcision testified innate depravity3
the purifications admitted the filthiness of sin3 sacrifices
indicated the heinousness of the guilt of the offerer. And
thisis, indeed, truly asserted: for the ceremonies, as far
as they are considered not as sacraments of Gospel grace,
but as appendages of the law, were nothing else, as Beza
properly remarks, than a public confession of human mi-
sery. Those words, τοῖς δόγμασι ονᾶἰιιαὴεθε, seem to confirm
this opinion, (for by ordinances the Apostle was wont to
denote the Jewish rites3 as in Ephes.⁴ ii. 15 ς) also the very
design of the Apostle in this place3 because he here con-
tends against those who endeavoured to restore Judaism,
as is plain from the inference iu verses 16 and 20. Ac-
cording to the opinion of those, then, tlze hand-wriz'ng is
said to be blotted out, i. e. the ceremonial rites are now
abrogated, because the debt itself being paid by Christ, it
is notjust that the bond should remain, which would tes-
tify that we are still debtors, and that the guilt of our sin
is not yet done away.

The two last opinions come nearest to the mind of the
Apostle: but both these and the former also seem to me to
be defective in this, that they restrict this hand-writing too
much, the one 10 the moral law alone, the other to the cere-
