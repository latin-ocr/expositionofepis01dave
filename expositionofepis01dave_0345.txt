Ver. 22. ErisTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 259

But concerning the distinction of those words which are
here brought together, we have forgotten to observe one
thing. The expression, then, to present us lzo(y, some refer
to God‚. in this sense, to present us such as God may ac-
knowledge for holy and dedicated to him. That next, zeu—
blamahk, they refer to the private conscience; that is to
say, that he may present us such as our own conscience
does not condemn3 according to that word, Rom. viii. l,
There is ηο condennmtion. Finally, that expression ἀνεγκλητους,
unreprorczble, they refer to others: to wit, that we be such
as our neighbours cannot deservedly blame—But we need
not lay much stress on the distinction of the words, since
it is the custom of the Holy Scriptores to bring together
synonimous words merely for the sake of a-mplification:
and perhaps the Apostle intended nothing else by collect-'
ing and uniting these three words, than to make known
that Christ the Mediator imparts his perfect righteousness
to all his people. But now let us gather some observa-
tions ε

1. By his saying, that He may present us· holy, not that
we should present ourselves lzoly, it is evident that those who
are reconciled and renewed have obtained their holiness
from Christ, whether we speak of it as actual, or inherent,
or by imputation. For we make no attenipts at good, if
they be not excited 3 and they are vain, if they be not as-
sisted. Whence that declaration of Paul, By tlte grace <ff
God Iam wlzat l am: I laboured more abundantly than they
all; ‚yet ηοι Ι, but the grace (ff Gocl which was with me. In—
fused righteousness remains not, neither is operative with-
out Christ: and imputed righteousness covers us only so
far as we are accounted in Christ, as members under the
head.

2. By his saying that Christ hath reconciled us that lte
might present us lioly, we readily understand that they are
not yet reconciled to God‚ who abide in their former iin-
purity3 for whomsoever Christ hath delivered from divine
wrath, them also hath he freed from the service of sin.
We must therefore beware, lest we flatter ourselves with a

false hope of reconciliation, without this evidence of sanc-
s ‘2
