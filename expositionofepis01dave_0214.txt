remainech inhim: and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
The Holy spirit is called seed, because by his power, as a
certain life-giving seed, men are rendered fruitful in good
works. Not much unlike this similitude is that of Parisi-
ensis, when he says, that virtues are calleclfmtits, because the
mind os the regenerate man is lilce a field sowed with the li 'e-
givz‘ng seed of the w0²d of God3 which conceives and brings
forth all kinds (ff virtues, from the graluitous and spiritual
embrace of its eterna] Spouse, ἰ. e. God.

cupy the ground in vain, neither dissipates the moisture
which it draws on leaves ancl blossoms alone; but produces
good fruits: so he alone is pleasing to God‚ who does not
uselessly occupy room in the Church, neither wears the
appearance and form of godliness alone, but puts forth its

a fruitful tree is pleasing to its Lord‚ and is customarily

branch which beareth fruit he pnrgeth ic that ic may bringforlh

*¹ Gregory Nazianzen z—Our Expositor has cited this Father before, with
advantage to his readers (vide p. 21 and 116) though it was not convenient
there to insert a sketch os him: But the beauty of this quotation induces us
to enquire into his character ; because it is not always the case, that the main-
tenance of Christian truth is an evidence of consistent conduct and fair pre·
tensions to Christian integrity-—Gregory‚ surnamed Nazianzen, from Na-
zianzum, a town of Cappadocia, of which his father was Bishop, was born
A.D. 324, at Azianzum, a village near it, and was one of the most illus-
trious ornaments of the Greek Church. He was made, much against his in-
clination, Bishop of Constantinople in 379; but was scarcely seated in his
Episcopate‚ than his tranquillity was disturbed hy a schism in his ChurchY
occasioned by the attempts of Maximus, a Cynic Philosopher, whom he
