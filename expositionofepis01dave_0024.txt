XiV LIFE OF BisuoP DAVENANT.

From the signature of Gomarus to this reply‚ it is evident, that
his subsequent bitterness against the Remonstrants at the Synod
of Dort, was the result of that acrimony which controversy so
often engenders; and that, at the period before us, he neither
considered the views of his Colleague as affecting the vitality of
the saith, nor even interrupting their private friendship3 although,
unhappily‚ afterwards, he denounced the former, as upsetting the
basis of the Gospel; spoke of the latter, when deceased, in terms
the most harsh and uncharitable‚ and fomented those persecuting
measures against his folIowers, which have rendered the name of
the Synod of Dort so odious.

This meddling interference of the Class of Dort, having
brought the whole question before the public, kindled a flame
through the United Provinces. In the heat of this, in the year
1609, Arminius died, with a spirit completely broken by the ca-
lumny and rancour with which he was assailed. His followers
abandoned many of the views which lie held in common with
Calvin‚ particularly on the vital point of Justification. They be-
came universally lax both in their opinions and in their society;
and, as has too often been the case, aversion from Calvinism be-
came a general hond of union. Having presented a strong re-
monstrance to the States-General in 1610, they obtained the name
of Remomtmznts, and their opponents having presented a (zounter-
remonstrance‚ were termed Contra-Remonstrants.

To settle these disputes, the Remonstrants demanded a General
Council of the Protestant Churches. This the States refused;
but it was at length determined by four out of seven of theUnited
Provinces‚ that a National Synod should be held at Dort-—a town
eminent for its hostility to the Arminians3 and letters were sent
to the French Huguenots‚ and to the different Protestant States of
Germany and Switzerland‚ requesting thern to send deputies to
assist at the deliberations. Among others, the King of England‚
James I.‚ was solicited in the same manner. And he, partly from
political motives‚ and partly from his love of theological contro-
versy, complied with the request, and selected for this purpose
five of the most eminent theologians in his realm. viz. Dr. George
Carleton, Bishop of Landaff, Dr. Joseph Hau, Dean of Worces-
ter, Dr. Daveimnt, Dr. Samuel Ward‚ Master of Sydney Sussex
College‚ and Walter Balcanqual, a presbyter of the Church of
Scotland3 and when Hau, on account of ill heahh, returned
home⁷ his place was filled by Dr. Goad‚ Precentor of St. Paul's‚

and Chuplain to the primate, Abbot.
