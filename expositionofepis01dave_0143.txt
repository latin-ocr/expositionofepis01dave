Ver. 3. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 57

Whence John xvii. 5, the Son says to the Father, Glorgfy
me with that glory which I lzad with thee before the world was.
But concerniug the Divine nature of Christ, we must speak
more largely hereafter. In respect also of the human na-
ture, Christ, by special privilege, is called the Son of
God3 and God, the Father of Christ: Luke i. 32, the Son
of the Highest: Luke xxiii. 46, Fadzer, into thy hands I
commend my spirit: John x. 363 and in many other pas-
Sages.

But it may be asked, Why, in this place, it was not suf-
ficient for the Apostle to say, We give thanks to God, but
he should also add, and to tlte Fatlzer of our Lord ,Iesus
Christ ?

Ι answer, first, he adds this for our consolation: for in
the verse preceding he had called God our Eatker ; in this ·
he calls the same God the Fatlcer of Christ. He intimates,
therefore, that we and Christ are brethren3 and thence that
our true Brother always intercedes with God the common
Father‚ for his brethren3 and that’is easily obtained from
the Father which the Son requests3 especially when he re-
quests any thing for his brethren‚ not for strangers, Heb.
ii. 11.

Secondly, to distinguish Christian invocation, from the
invocation of Heathens and Jews. For an Heathen in-
vokes and praises God Almiglcty, wlzo made tlze heaven and
the earth; a Jew invokes the God of Abraham, and Isaac,
and ιῙαεοῖ); but Christians alone invoke and acknowledge
God the Father qf our Lord Jesus Christ.

Lastly, that he might shew that the benefits of God the
Father are derived to us through his Son and our Brother
Jesus Christ. For unless God were the Father of Christ,
and of us through Christ, we should have no hope of ob-
taining the benefits of God„

Praying alwaysfor you] The Apostle here shews for
whom he gives thanks, viz. for the Colossians3 and when,
praying always, i. e. always when we do pray.

Observe 1. In that the Apostle gives so frequent, so
regular thanks to God for benefits conferred upon others,
he shews the nature of Christian love, which rejoiccs willz
