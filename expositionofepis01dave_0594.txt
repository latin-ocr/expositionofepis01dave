508 AN EXPOSlTloN or ST. PAUL’S Clmp. ii.

fold account. First (as ye perceive) because it proceeded
from those who are accustomed rashly to invent and boldly
to speak about matters altogether unknown to them. For
when he says intruding into those things which he hatlz not
seen, his meaning is, Determining or decreeing concerning
those things the cerlaz'nty of which he neither sees to he revealed
in the word (ff God to the eye fffaz'th, nor has investigated by
thejudgment (ff α sound reason, nor comprehended in a way (ff
certain knowledge. Towards these, that remark of the
Apostle, 1 Tim. i. 7, applieS, Desz‘ring to be teachers, under-
standlng neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. For
if you ask those who would have angels and saints to be
worshipped by us with invocations, dedications of temples
and altars, promising of vows, and other religious ceremo-
nies, whence they learn that this worship is to be paid
them3 they cannot say that they learn it from the word of
God, or from the example of prophets or apostles, or from
any certain ground, but that they only so determine oftheir
own will concerning things altogether unknown to them.
Proceed and ask them, since they would have saints and
angels to be invoked by us, how they can persuade us that
they hear always and receive the prayers of all those who
supplicate them: Some will answer, that angels and saints,
from the beginning of their happiness, see all things which
are performed by us, in the mirror of the Divinity3 others
think that our prayers are revealed by God himself to those
whom we invocate, from the very instant we utter our
prayers3 some suppose that the saints know the prayers of
men from the relation of angels. But of these things they
have nothing established by sound reason. So Cajetan, in
Qu. 2. qu. 88. art. 5, ingenuously confesses, W‘e are not cer-
tain that the saints hear our prayer-s, though we piously believe
it. They intrude themselves, therefore, into those things
which they know not.

Hence we may infer:

l. That their bold curiosity is not to be endured who
intrude themselves into the determining of things the in-
vestigation of which surpasses human wit. For, as the
