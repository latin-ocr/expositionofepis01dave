Ver. 19. EPlSTLE To Tus cotossifos. 515

2. To adhere to the Roman Pontiff as a visible head,
does not constitute a true member of the Church3 but to
adhere to Christ the Head. Therefore, hypoci·iteS,and the
ungodly, are not true members of the Catholic Church, to
whatever visible chnrch they mayjoin themselves, unless
by thejoints of the Spirit and of saith they are united to
Christ.

3. As to doctrine and saving grace, the whole body of
the Church is supplied from its head, not one member by
another. Whence Theodoret, on this text, sayS, The
Charch receives both tlzefountains (ff doctrine, and the matter

not only to their Head, but to one another: for, as it is
said in Rom. xii. 5, We being man-es are one body in Christ,
&Q And the hands, or σύνδεσμοι, by whose power we are
knit together in one body, are the same of which we have
before spoken; the spirit, and the gifts of the Spirir. For
the same Spirit which unites us to Christ, is that principal
band by which we are united to one another: for by one
Spirit are we all baplz'zed into one body, l Cor. xii. 13. Now
after this Spirit is infused into all the ligaments of the
Church, it enkindles in every one that excellent gift of
charity which is also the firmest hond of cohesion. There
