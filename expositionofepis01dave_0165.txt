Ver. 5. EPISTLE 'ro THE conossmns. 79

book De Anima3 Some one may I ask, When shall Ι come to
this hopedfor joy? Patience answers, When God shall be
pleased to give it.- for no (lelay of that which, will certainly
come is long.

Secondly, The promised blessedness is called our hope, ’
i. e. the thing which we hope for: through an Antonoma-
sia ᾗ* that hence we may be led to consider that this object
alone is worthy of our hope3 and that other frail and tran-
sitory things which are commonly hoped for and sought
after, are, in comparison with this heavenly prize, rather to
be trampled under foot than hoped for or sought after.

Lastly, By this term the carnal and worldly are reproved,
who neither care nor hope for future blessedness; they co-
vet only the pleasures of the present life, and into those
they plunge themselves. But as Cyprian speaks, De bono'

hope: for what a man seetlc, why dotlz he hopesor it ? Rom.
viii. 24. Neither is it said that this prize is only offered to
us, and proposed3 for it would weaken our hope, if the
certainty of the things hoped for should depend upon our-
selves and our disposition, so as either to be given to us or
denied, according to the merit of our works. But it is said to
be laid upfor us, i. e. hiddenin reserve with God our Father.
But ifany thing be in reserve for us, even with a good and
honest man, we entertain no doubt concerning its future re-
covery3 nay, our goods are placed for that end with ano-

put the name of some office, possession, or dignity3 or to one obJect the
