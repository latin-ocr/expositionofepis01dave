Ver. 4. EPISTLE To Tur. COLOSSIANS. 59

sires from God a confirmation of those gifts; as ye shall
hereafter hear.

And so far concerning the congratulatory proposition.
The narration and the illustration of the cause of this giv-
ing of thanks follows3 the narration in the 4th verse3 for
there he names those good things which had excited him
to give thanks to God, viz. their saith and love. The il-
lustration follows to the 9th verse.

Ver. 4. Since we heard of your saith ‘in Christ Jesus, and
the love which με have to all the saints.

In this fourth verse, the Apostle explains (as I have said)
the cause of his joy and congratulation: and he does it by
the enumeration of certain spiritual gifts which were con-⁴
spicuous among the Colossians. Here he specifies two;
viz.faz'tlz and love: and each gift he illustrates by annex-
ing, not its adequate, but its primary and principal object3
faitli in Christ, love towards the saints.

Yourfaitlz] By saith here he means the profession of
the Christian religion, which the Colossians had embraced,
through the ministry and preaching of Epaphras and
others; not indeed the external profession of saith alone,
but an internal and sincere faith dwelling in the heart: for
by the rule of charity, the latter is always to be presumed
in the former, unless hypocrisy and impiety be discovered
to evince the contrary. ‚

He places this faith in the foreground, and puts it before
other spiritual gifts, because it is in its nature prior to the
rest. For it is the foundation and root of godliness and
religion; it is the gate of life, through which God first en-
ters into the human mind3 it is the basis of the spiritual
building. For as in the creation light preceded the other
creatures3 for God said, Let there be light, and there was
light on tkefirst day.- so in the work of regeneration, God
says, Let there be the light of saith, and it first shines in
the mind, then other virtues follow. The very first ap-
proach to God is made ilii-oughfaitlz‚ Heb. xi. 6. The first
purffication of the human heart is effected by suilli, Acts
