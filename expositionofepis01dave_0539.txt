Ver. 13. EPJSTLE To THE cotossmNs. 453

the controul of reason in depraved man3 they restrain it,
they bind it, and lead it captive whithersoever they are in-
chned„

Now let us sum these points together. The mind has
lost its light, and is buried in darkness3 the will lias lost
its rectitude, and is filled with perversity3 the affections
have lost their subjection, and are pleased with rebellion:
and all these evils derive their origin from the [incircumci-
sion of our fiesh, i. e. from the infection of corrupt nature:
we are, therefore, rightly affirmed by the Apostle to be

follow the will (ff man. And Parisiensis is of the same opi—
nion in his treatise De virtut. Godfirst bestows efforts and
preparations, that &hirzveit-ds lie may con er more. Each of
these divines had been taught by the prophet, who denies
that conversion is in the corrupt will of man, but depends
upon the Divine compassion: Turn thou us unto thee, O
Lord, and we shall be turned, Lament. v. 21.

2. Since every man is spiritually dead, he not only can-
not dispose himself to quicken his own soul, but he can-
not dispose himself to any motion to quicken and convert
himself either external or internal, unless his mind be
