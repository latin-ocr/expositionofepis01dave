466 AN EXPOSirioN OF ετ. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

having asserted in the foregoing verse, that all our sins are
forgiven us; he subjoinS‚ that the hand-writing itseff is blot-
tect out: but lest any one should think that it is not so blot-
ted out, but that a new charge may be raised, he therefore
adds, it is moreover taken out of the way.- and lest it should
be thought to be preserved hidden somewhere, and may be
preferred against us hereafter3 nay, says he, it is nailed to
hvis cros-5, i.e. it is torn and rent in pieces by those nails
wherewith Christ was affixed, and lacerated upon the cross.
And, indeed, the guilt of our sins being expiated, and the
condemning power of the moral law ceasing‚ the ceremo-

can be blotted out. They will fall, therefore, into the
hands of the living God‚who will at last require from them
the uttermost farthing of the debt.

2. We here see the insane pride of Pharisees and Pa-
pists, who think that they themselves can satisfy God
when he deals with them according to this hand-writing of
the law 3 yea, pay more than is due to him from the haud-
wriffing, by counting up works of supererogation, as they
call them : but what need, then, for the blotting out of the
hand-writing by the cross of Christ?

From its contrariety, we learn,

1. Since this hand-writing is said to be contrary to, and
against us: we gather from hence, that our nature is de-
praved and corrupted: for. according to the terms of the
first institution, the law of God was not contrary to us, but
