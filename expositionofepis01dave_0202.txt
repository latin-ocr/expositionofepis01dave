116 AN EXPOSITION or sr. PAUL'S Chap. 1.

Concerning this the Apostle speaks, Ephes. iv. 7, To every
one of yon is given grace, according to the measure· (ff the g'fl
of Christ. And Augustine, in Psalm xxxviii. There is a
certain perfectiori, according to the measure of this life ; oud z't
belongs to that perfectiore, that each lfnows thot he is not yet
perfect. This perfection and plenitude of grace the Apos-
tle desires for the Colossians in this prayer.

Hence we are taught that we ought never to think that
we have attained the fulness of any grace destined for us
in this life3 but we ought always to strive and to seek from
God, that we may be filled more and more with all spiritual
gifts.

We are, whilst we live here, as children who are not yet
arrived at maturity ε whence the holy Scriptures excite all
to a constant advance in every gift of divine grace. Lest
I should be tedious, Ι will only note the places, I will not
recite them. To the increase of saith, 2 Cor. x. 15: of
hope, Rom. xv. 13: of love, Ephes. iv. 15: of knowledge,
Ephes. iii. 19 ε of all grace, 2 Pet. iii. 18. Many passages
from the Fathers might be adduced for this opinion. Na-
zianzen, for instance, says, A Christian either adt-ames or
falls back; he cannot remaiu in the same state. Bernard says,
He is by no means good who does not wisse to be better ; and
where you begin to be unwilling to become better, there you

leave off to be good.ss
