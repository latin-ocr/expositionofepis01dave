374 AN EXPOSITION or s'r. PAUL'S Chap. ii.

3. That. state of the people which affords an occasion
of joy to the minister, ought likewise to afford occasion of
greater solicitude3 for Paul, in consequence of his joy at
beholding their present state, laboured the more earnestly
lest they should be cast down from the same by the deceit
of iinpostors. For he knew the malice of the devil‚ wlzo
