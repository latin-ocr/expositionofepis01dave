Ver. 14. EPISTLE 'ro ‘run cotossxANS. 461

1. What the Apostle understands by the hand-writing in
ordinances, or decrees.

2. How this hand—writing was contrary to ας, and against
us,

3. How it is now made void: Which making void he
amplifies by three words 3 it is blotted ont. it is taken out (ff
the way, it is uailed to his cross.

l. · Concerning the hand-writz'ng (ff ordinances, or con-
firmed and scaled as it were in ordl'nances, the opinions of
interpreters are various3 yet all agree in this, that they
suppose something to be intended under this word, which
may, by force of testimony, prove us guilty before God.
¹ And indeed, rightly : for this is the use of a hand-writing
or bond, that to this the creditor may appeal, and convict ⁴
the debtor, if he attempt to evade or disavow the debt: the
very purport, therefore, of the metaphor‚ compels us to
find out some such meaning.

Some of the Fathers assert that this hand-writc'ng is
nothing else than that covenant of God with Adam, Gen.
ii. 17, Of tlze fruit of tlze tree of the knowledge cf good and
evil thou ‘mayest not eat ; for z'n tlze dcl-y in wlziclc thou eatest
thereos thou skalt surely die; for this being violated, both
Adam himself and his posterity were held guilty of death
as by a bond. Others refer it to that stipulation of the
Jewish people, promising that they would perform all things
which God commanded by Moses: for so it is written,
Exod. xix· 7, 8, When BIoses had laid before them all the
words which tlte Lord commanded him, all the people answered
together and said, All that the Lord bath spoken we will do.
By this promise, therefore, they bound themselves, as by
a hand-writing‚ to the perfect obedience of the law 3 which,
neverffieless, they performed not; and, therefore, might
be justly condemned from th'is their own hand.-——Some, by
tlte hand-writz'ng, understand the remembrance of our sins,
written, as it were, in the Divine mind and each one's own
conscience3 whereto the prophet alludes, saying‚ I will
blot out thy sransgressions, and will not remember thy sins,
Isa. xliii. 25. When, therefore, they are not blotted out,
we may be convictecl, as by a bond, from the testimony
