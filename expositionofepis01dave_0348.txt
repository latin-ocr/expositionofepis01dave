262 AN EXI’OSITION or ST. rAcLs Claap. i.

So it is regarded Rom. iii. 22, The righteousness of God, by
saith of Jesns Christ, is unto all ancl upon all tlzem that believe.
And Gal. ii. 16, We lcnow that a man. is not justffied by the
worlcs of the law, bnt by thefaitlz of Jesns Christ. Whence
said Augustine, De civit. lib. 19. cap. 26, The perjection of
our rigltteonsness is placed rather in the remission of our sins
than in the perfectiore of onr virtues. And, Contra duas
Epist. pelag, lib. 3. cap. 5, Onrsaitlz delernn'nes that of un-

2. The kind of faith of those who are truly reconciled
to God which constitutes them holy and unreprovable in
his sight, is not an uncertain, temporary‚ and illusory faith 3

ii. 19.

3. Upon what foundation this saith rests3 even upon
the free promises of God which are offered in the Gospel.
This the Apostle shews in saying, and belse not mered from
the hope (ff the Gospel: for the lzope oftlze Gospel denotes the
expectation of those rewards which the Gospel promises to
believers. For there is this difference between the Law
and the Gospel : the Law puts the hope of eternal life under
the condition of works and of perfect obedience; He that
doeth these things shall live in them, Levit. xviii. 5 : but the
