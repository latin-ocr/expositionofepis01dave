Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE cotossmns. 39

monies of Scripture, that the regenerata know that they
are born again of the spirit, and the faithful know them-
selves to be the faithful: Thus 1 Cor. xi. 12, We have re-
ceived the spirit which is of God, that we may know the
things which are given us of God; 2 Cor. xiii. 5, Know ye
not that Christ is in you except ye be reprobates? 1 John iv.
13, We [σηοω that we abide in him, and he in us, because lze
hath given us of his Spiric. For saith, as light, not only
makes other things, but itself visible.

2. From the nature of the promises. The promises of
gospel grace and the reinission of sins, through the re-
conciliation of Christ, are to be so believed by us as to
afford firm and solid consolation: but unless I in particu-
lar believe that Ι am reconciled, and that I am absolved¹
from sins, they cannot yield this consolation. The former
is evident, because the very end of gospel grace and of the
divine promises is, that we may leave strong consolation,
Heb. vi. 18. But that general saith of the Papists, that
every one who believes truly and lives piously‚ hath remis-
sion of sins3 or that conditional saith, I, if Iam faithful,
am in the grace of God, does not yield strong consolation,
because it may consist with despair. It is necessary, says
Bernard, to believe that you cannot have forgiveness, unless by
the mercy* o] God,· but at the same time believe this, that your
own sins areforgiven yon through him. Bernard, De annunt.
Serm. 2. And the reason is because promises of God do
not take effect until they have been accepted by us3 al-
though, therefore, remissiou of sius, upon condition of faith,
be offered to all, yet it must of necessity be accepted by
men individually and singly, that it may be useful and sa-
lutary to each one. Promises are not accepted by those
who do not, but by those who do know, and understand,
and feel, that they apprehend and accept them.

3. The Holy Spirit specially seals each particular be-
liever, and makes him sure of his adoption, by a certain
wonderful and secret testimony ε for he is given to every

'⁸‘ The Indzngentia plenaria, plenior and plenissima, with other expressions,
shews that the Scholastics gave the force of forgiveness to Indulgentiae, as if
in oppositioni to absolute justice.
