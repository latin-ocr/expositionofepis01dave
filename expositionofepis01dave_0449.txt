Ver. 3. EPISTLE To 'run coLossmNS. 363

is incomprehensible. But as far as regards tlze creatures,
they say that Christ in the Word knows all things which
are, and which will be, whether things spoken, done, or
thought by any morta13 because he is to be the judge of
all. They affirm, moreover, that he knows all the essence,
and power, aud acting of every creature, because he is the
Lord of all. They, therefore, conclude, if we speak con-
cerning knowledge as it respects the creatures, that the
soul of Christ, as to the number qs tlze things known, has a
knowledge equal with God; because he knows all the crea-
tures even as God3 but as to the means of knowing, and tlze
mode oflcnowz'ng, his knowledge is far inferior ε For because

they abuse this passage to establish their error, In whomare
hid all the treasures, διο.

We answer, nothing cau be concluded from this passage
in favour of that absolute omniscience of the soul of Christ,
on many accounts. First, because it is much more likely
that the Apostle speaks concerning our saving wisdom,
which we have in rightly knowing Christ, than concerning
the wisdom of Christ himself. Secondly, because if it be
granted that he speaks concerning the wisdom and know-
ledge with which the soul of Christ is endued, we may in-
terpret this of that highest fulness of created and infused
knowledge, in which there is nothing wanting that is re-
quired to perfect the soul of Christ, although there may
not be ouiuiscience, of which the creature cannot properly
