Ver. 4. EPISTLE To THE conossmns. 69

love3 therefore the habit itself of true saith naturally pre—
cedes the habit of love. For we believe and repose our
faith on God before we are able to love him.

4. From the Apostle to the Galatians v. 6, In Christ
J esus neither circumcision availetlz any thing, nor uncircumcision‚
bnt saith which worketlz by love: therefore faith is the effi-
cient cause of love, and hence love is not the form of saith,
but its daughter or handmaid.

But when they (the Papists) are driven to straits, they
endeavour to explain their opinion in this way : That love
is the form of saith, not in such manner as in natural
things, a form is said to give the shape to materia13 but
only in this respect, that by lov-e the act of saith is per-
fected z for faith hath its entire efficacy and merit from love.
Thus Aquinas, Q. 2. quaest. 4, art. 3. and qu. disp. de fide, ⁸
art. 5. And Durandus, lib. 3. dist. 33. quaest. 8, Love is
not the inherent, lmt extrinsic form of faith; neither does it
become aform ‹gffaith as being of its nature, but assat· as it
is meram-iona*

But all these things are fallacious and weak. For, first,
love does not elicit nor perfect the proper act of faith;
because although they are simultaneous. yet naturally the
act and even the habit of faith precedes the act and habit
of love.

Secondly‚ love does not, as they think, render the act·
of faith meritorious, or acceptable to God: but on the con-
trary, the power of meriting (as they speak) i. e. of ren-
dering our actions acceptable, is placed more especially in
faith than in love. For without faith it is impossible that
the act of loving can be acceptable to God. Also the re-
generate man renounces his own understanding through
faith, before he does his own will through love. Love
therefore is not the form, but the offspring of true saith.

Hitherto we have considered the gift itself of love z Now
letus come to the object.

To all saints] Where two things are to be remarked:
the objectos love, specified in this place, the saints,- and
the extent of the object, all saints.

“ “ Nec informat fidem quoad esse naturae, sed quoad esse meritorium.”
