5. He endeavours to find a fifth testimony from those

passages where remission is proposed to the penitent under
the form of a doubt: Joel ii. ]2, 14, Tum unto me with all
your beart. Who knows if Gocl will return and repent? And
Acts viii. 22 (in reference to Simon Magus), Repent‚ if
perhaps the thought <ff thy beart may be forgiven thee. These,
and like passages, says Bellarmin, signify an uncertainty
of remission, not in respect of the divine promise, but in
respect of our disposition.

To the first testimony another Jesuit shall answer this
Jesuit. Thus then Ribera* upon this passage, Who lcnows
if God will return and repent? says, That is, perhaps he will
not szffer the Chaldeans to come into yom- land, nor that με
shall be led captives, if γε will repent. The prophet, then,
does not direct them to doubt of the remission of their
sins if they turn, nor does he command the truly penitent
to doubt the fact of their penitence3 but he shews that he
himself is not certain concerning the removal of external
judgments, although they turn: respecting this, therefore,
they might hope, concerning the other they might be cer-
tain. Moreover, he shews from Ambmse, that this phrase
is not always expressive of doubt3 and from Gregory, that
it sometimes indicates the difficulty of a thing, and the
searcity of instances in which it has been done.

To the second likewise Ribera answers3 That Peter lead
ηο doubt of his sin being remitted, on his repentance ; but lze
doubted ²s the penitenceof Simon would be real. That may

'⁵ Ribera (Franciscus de): A Spanish Scholar of the sixteenth century3
who acquired a high reputation for his intimate acquaintance not only with
the Latin, butalso the Greek and Hebrew Languages3 at the same time
being considered one of the most excellent Divines of his age. Being or-
dained a Priest, Ribera retired to his Alma Mater at salamanca, to pursue
his theological studies in uninterrupted privacy, and was then persuaded to
enter the Society of Jesuits; a member of which body he continued till his
death in 1591, after having filled the Chair of Professor of Divinity in the
University of Salamanca for thirty years. He wrote Commentaries on the
Minor Prophets and on St. John's Gospel, with other works, mostly pub-
lished after his death, and eulogised in high, but evidently deserved and
just terms, by his Roman Catholic Biographers.
