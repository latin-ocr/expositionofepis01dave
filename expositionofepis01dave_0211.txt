Ver. 10. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 125

word itself is often used: Rom. xv. 2, Le( every one qs you·
please lais melgbbour. And Gal. i. lO, If Ipleased men I
should not be tlte servant of God.

But as the Apostle adds a note of universality, that με
φηςι-ῃ please in ΑΗ, things, so the Greek Scholia explain it by
distribution into λογοις, εργοις, και Romam, words, work-s, (as
well internal as external) and also doctrines.

The reason why the Apostle emphatically requires this
general intention of pleasing God, is this3 Because the
end determines the quality in moral things, as the form
does in natural things. Our dutz‘es are to be judged of, not
by the beginning but by the end, says August. in Ps. cxviii.
And, lib. iv. contr. Julian, cap. 3, Whalez-er good is done,
and is (Zone not on this account, because it ought to be (Ione, al-
though it seems good in tlze view of its being a matter of duty,
yet tbe end itself not being right, it is sin. So Clem. Strom.¹
6. The acti012 (ff erery bealben isfoul, because he has vot the
right end in view. The scope therefore of our whole life
ought to be this, that we may please God, and may glorify
him thereby.

But here, in regard to the intention of pleasing God, it
behoves us to resolve some doubts.

Itis asked, l. Whether in every good work, the actual
intention of pleasing God be necessary through the whole
course of the work? For instance; A dutiful son obeys
his parents with the intention of pleasing G0d; I ask, whe-
ther he sins in any particular instance of duty, if he should
not always actually keep this intention in mind ‘3

I answer; It suffices if that intention should have pre-
ceded, and be habitually retained, although it be not
thought upon in every single act : sor many operations pro-
ceed by virtue of some primary intention, although the ac-
tual intention hath ceased to accompany them. As a dart,
by the single impulse of -him who throws it, is borne
through an intermediate space to a point, although he
thinks not either of the space or the point3 so a good work
proceeds from a single impulse of the will to its mark,
when the perforrner no longer actually thinks of the mark
and of his first intention. The same may be illustrated by
