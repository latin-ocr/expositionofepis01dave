intimating, in this manner, that that in which those hypo-
crites would have the all in all of holiness to consist, was
altogether a thing ridiculous.

From what hath been said these instructions follow:

l. There is no end of ceremonies and traditions, if
once they are admitted with an opinion of merit and holi-
ness : for the authority of seducers always will proceed to
the imposition of severer matters. Wittily said Calvin,
They tie you up at the beginning, that they may strangle you
afterwards.

2. We must resist the ordinances of hypocrites of this
sort, not only because they are full of error in themselves,
but also on account of the dangerous consequence. For
God hath prescribed certain and fixed things in his wor-
ship: but if you allow men this power to prescribe their
traditions‚ under the notion of worship, they will daily
heap on more and heavier3 neither is there any end of their
burden.

3. They who make holiness to consist in difference of
meats, or in external observations of this kind, however
they may seem to themselves to philosophize wisely, are,
nevertheless, contemptible, and to be derided for their
pains.

4. Seducers for the most part prohibit, by their autho-
rity, things allowed by God, and very necessary, as meat,
drink, marriage; they impose and enjoin superfluous and
ridiculous matters, as the worship of imageS, long pilgri-
mages, muttering of prayers not understood, according to
,a certain calculation‚ and other charnis, not only abhorrent
from all religion, but even reason itself.

We conclude, therefore, that the consciences of Chris—
tians are not to be burdened either by these rites, which re-
late to differences of meats‚ or by any which consist in the
observance of external things, as though they were parts
of sacred worship or religion.
