nothing else than to place thefoot upon, or to enter into pos-
session of any thing : For thus did the false apostles thrust
themselves into things the most unknown and obscure, as
into a house very familiar to them, or in their own posses-
sions‚ where they governed and determined as they pleas-
ed, and imposed upon Christians according to their own
will.

Those last words, vainly ngffed up by hisfleshly mind, are
explained in different modes, but with no difference of
sense. For whether we render it by the sense of lzz'sfleslz, or
by tlze mind of hisflesh, or by hisfleslzly mind, or, lastly, by
the persuasiou of hisfleslc; it speaks the same thing, viz.
that the seducers drew their doctrine, not from the revela-
tion of the Divine spirit, but from the presumption of hu-
man reason. But we dismiss the explanation of the words
and proceed to the matter itself.

In these l8th and 19th verses is contained the second
part of the Apostle’s conclusion, which is an inference
from the discussion already considered. And here he re-
jects that corruption of religion which had its origin from
a deceitful philosophy. For as the Jews (whom he had re-
futed in the two preceding verses) obtruded the Mosaic ce-
remonies3 so others introduced curicus speculations from
the schools of the philosophers, and particularly the wor-
shipping of angels, which is found among the dogmas of
the Platonists. For Plato, in 4. De legibus, prescribes,
that, after the tutelary gods, daemons are to be worshipped.
And in Epinomide, he says, that dcemons ought to be wor-
shipped because they hold the middle place between the gods aud
men ,· and discharge the office of interpretem .· they are there-
fore to be worshipped χάριν τνῗς ἐυθημου διαπορειας, for their
propitietis and happy intercession between Gocl ancl men.

work was a translation of some treatises of Plutarch ς and in 1508, he pub-
lished notes on the Pandects. But his great reputation as a critic depende
on his treatise “ De Asse,'' relating to the weights, coins, and measures of
the antients; and his ‘⁶ Commentarii Linguae Graecae,’' a rich treasure of
Philological science. He was employed on embassies by Louis XII. and
by Francis L, the latter of whom made him his Secretary and Librarian.
He died in 1540, in the 731] year of -his age.
