at all de non quaesz‘tis concerning discipline, they think they hat}
not herein been wanting to their Synodical duty and calling t—-the
rather for that,

“ l. They were sent to endeavour the peace and composure of
that distracted church, by expressing their judgments in the points
there already controverted, not by intruding in matters not at
all questioned among them.

‘⁶ 2. Among the instructions given them by his Majesty‚ they
had none to meddle with the discipline there established ; but had
charge to use moderation and diseretion, and to abstain from
multiplying of questions beyond necessity.

‘⁴ 3. In that subject, there was no hope or possibility of pre-
vailing by argument or persuasion; especially in that church,
where the civil government is popular, and so complieth more
easily with ecclesiastical parity.

‘⁶ Yet we thought not fit to content ourselves with warrantable
silence; but, upon our return from that Synodical Session to the
place of our private collegiate meefflng, we diligently perus-ed the
confession, not only for points of doctrine referred to our judg-
ments, but also for those accepted (excepted) articles touching
discipline: and consulting together what was fit to be done in
delivering our opinions next day, we jointly concluded, that,
howsoever our church discipline had not been Synodically taxed,
nor theirs avowed‚ yet it was convenient for ns, who were assured
in our consciences that their presbyterial parity and laical pres-
bytery was repugnant to the discipline established by the Apostles
and retained in our chureii, to declare, in a temperate manner,
ourjudgment‚ as well concerning that matter, though by them
purposely excepted‚ as the other expressly referred to us.

‘⁶ Accordingly, the next morning, when suffrages were to pass
concerning the doctrine comprised in that confession, we, having
by our place the prime voice in the Synod, gave our approbation
of the substance of the doctrinal articles, with advice touching
some incommodious phrases3 and withal‚ contrary to the expec-
tation of the whole Synod, we added express exception against
the suppressed articles, with some touch also of argument against

· them. Which our contestation, or protestation‚ for so it may be
styled‚ was principally performed by him, whom for priority of
age, place, and dignity, it best became; and from whose person
and gravity it might be the better taken, by the civil deputies of
the States there present. ¹
