LII-‘12 OF BlSIIOP DAVENANT. XVll

returned home, and were very graciously welcomed by the King,
and with high approbation of their conduct. It is evident, how-
ever, that their labours in sofrening the decrees, and the general
moderation of their conduct, had rendered them objeets of suspi-
cion to many in tlie Synod‚ Dr. ward, in a letter to Archbishop
Usher, says, “ We had somewhat to do, when we came to srame
canons, with the provincials, and some of the exteri, touching
some points, especially touching the second article. Some of us
were held by some half Remonstrants‚ for extending the oblation

scarcely attempted to be concealed. The council consisted of
those alone whose views were well known. The President, Boger-
man. had long been distinguished for his extreme bitterness against
the followers of Arminius; and the official details of the Synod
