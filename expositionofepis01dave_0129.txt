it to be understood concerning those whose sins, upon
true repentance, have been remitted ε They ought not to be
without fear concerning propitiation and remission ofsins3
for instance, adultery‚ theft, drunkenness, or any other:
but that fear is, not lest the sin should not be remitted‚
but lest the same and greater imputation should return if it
be again committed. For sins remitted return through ingra-
ticude, not as it regards the act, but inasmuclz as he who falls
again isfor his ingratitude rendered liable to much greater
punishment than if his sin had not beffbre been absolved. Du-

4. A fourth argument Bellarmin draws from those pas-
sages where justification and remissiori of sins is proposed
under a condition. [f tlze wicked man shall repent Jor all
his sins, lze shall live, Ezek. xviii. Ye shall be my friends if
pse do what Icommand you, John xv. ; and the like. But
no one can be certain by the assurance of faith, that he is
turned to the Lord with all his beart, and hath true faith
and penitence such as is required3 since no where in Scrip-
ture is a testimony of this kind found concerning our faith
and penitence in particular.

I answer3 To receive the grace of remission‚ the condi-
tion of saith and true penitence is necesssry on our part;
but what he adds, That no one knows whether his saith and
repentance be such and so great as is required by God, is
most false. Forjustification does not depend on the de-
gree or measure of saith or penitence, but upon the genu-
ineness: And every man who hath received saith and re-
pentance by the gift of the spirit, has experienced that his
saith and penitence are true, and not hypocritical, as was
before shewn. Whence that saying of Augustine in Ps.
cxlix. There is a mode ofglorying in tlte consciousness that
you leave ascertained your saith to be sincere, yom- hope cer-
tain, and your love without dissimulation. As to his plea,
that a testimony concerning οιιν faith, or om· remissiori in
particular, is not found in Scriptum, we will explain it
when we come to the reasonings of Bellarmin3 for there
this will recur-
