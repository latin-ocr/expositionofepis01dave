Christ, then, was from all eternity, and always will be,
the uncreated WORD, the perfect, essential, and invisible
image of his invisible Father. Before either angels or
men existed, to contemplate this image by mental vision,
yet even then, he was the image of his Father:

l. Because he possessed the exact likeness of him, for
he was χαρακτηρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως ἀυτοιῗ, Heb. i. 3, tlte ei‘press
image of lzz's person.

2. He inoreover had this likeness drawn and derived
from God the Father through that wonderful and ineffable
generation from the Father. For the eternal Father, know-
ing himself from eternsty, begets the Word, the consub-
stantial image of himself. If any one expects aught from me
concerning the mode, he shall have that sentiment of Ain-
brose: leou art commanded to believe: it is not permilled

such singular suavity and wisdom, that a cry was raised--‘ Let Ambrose
be Bishop: But he was exceedingly averse to accept a function to which he
had been so unexpectedly but honourably chosen. No person, indeed, could

ever be more dcsirous to rush into the office of a Bishop, than he seems ”

to have been to avoid a post of such distinction and responsibility: but,
when induced to accept it, he entered upon its duties with equal assiduity
and diffidence. He preached every Sabbath, and attended to every thing
incumbent upon him in such a station, with evident sincerity and the most
undeviating fidelity and justice. He had succeeded to Auxentius, an
Arian3 but he soon effected the expulsion of Arianism from Italy. He
became no less eminent for his eloquence as a Divine, than he had been as
a Lawyer3 and, on various occasions, had to display it; which he did with
the greatest success, both on behalf of the truth against the Arians, and of
the church, against Maximus and Justinia the Mother of Valentinian. He
gave a remarkable evidence of firmness in refusing the Sacrament to Theo-
dosius, and even denied him entrance into the church of Milan, on account

ot' cruelties the emperor had exercised at Thessalonica ; representing to him
