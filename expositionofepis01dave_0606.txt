‚520 AN Exl’osi'rioN or· ετ. ΡΑυιέ Clmp. ii.

From the foregoing remarks these observations arise :

l. They who have given their names to Christ are bound
to follow the doctrine of the Gospel alone as to righteous-
ness and salvation. For Ambrose on this passage rightly
says 3 Erery one ‘who is baptized into Christ, renomces all su-
perstitious, that he may exercise saith alone in Christ.

2. They who force Christians to Jewish ceremonies,
exercise tyranny over the. people of God, and require tri-
bute, as it were, from the dead: for the dead are. not inore
delivered from the sway of magistrates, than Christians from
the law of Moses. Whence holy Scripture sometimes says,
that we are dead. and delivered from these rudiments ; some-
times, that the law ilsels is made void and demi,- that it may
be understood by all, that the conscie-noes of Christians
ought in no way to be subject to thern.

3. If not to those, then much less are consciences to
be ensnared by ordinances of human invention, so as to be
driven to seek holiness, righteousness, and salvation in
them. For if they are obtruded for this end, they are
crushed by that bolt, In vain do they worship me by tlze com-
mandments qs men.

4. Therefore, not only do they sin who invent new de-
crees in religion, but they who subject themselves to the
same, and suffer the liberty procured by the blood of
Christ, to be snatched from them. Why are ye subject to
ordinances? says the Apostle: As though he had said, It
is your duty to refuse this yoke, and lo walle in the liberty
wleerewith Christ leath made you free, as he advises, Gal.
v. l.

But here, by the way, it is proper to give this admoni-
tion3 that all these things are to be understood of those
rites and ceremonies which are obtruded as parts of Divine
worship, as necessary duties os sanctification and righ-
teousness, as obligatory upon the conscience in themselves.
For if ordinances are instituted by 'those who preside over
the Church, for the sake of order; as about the becoming
apparel of ministers, the time of public fasts or festivals,
and, finally, of all that external discipline which ought to
