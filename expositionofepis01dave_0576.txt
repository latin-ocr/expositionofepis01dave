although Christ had then been exhibited, and the Gospel
laid open3 because he speaks of them as considered in
their nature, abstracted from the circumstances of time:
for this is the custom of disputants. So that if any one
should now be asked‚ What the legal ceremonies were?
he might answer, They are shadows of things to coine3 not
that they now actually exist, or did shadow forth things to
come, but that this may be the definition and nature of the
ceremonies considered in themselves.

But it may be shewn that the things to come, viz. Christ,
and grace, and the doctrine of the Gospel, were shadowed
forth in all: but we shall only insist upon those that are
particularized by the Apostle in this place, namely, rneats
and holy days. Concerning meats, that saying of Christ
appears most true3 Not that which goellz into the mouth de-
fileth α man ‚· but those things which come out (fflhe mouth, and
the heart, they defile the mmm Matth. xv. Therefore, that
certain meats are forbidden as unclean, is not to be referred
to the nature of the things, but to the signification, and to
the shadowing forth obscurely of the moral doctrine, which
now is clearly taught by the Gospel. The law forbad le-
vened bread to be eaten‚ 111 the seven first days of the Pass-
over, Exod. xii. 153 but what was shadowed forth by this
ceremony St. Paul shews, l Cor. v. 7, Purge out the old le-
ven that με may be α new lump, Sto. In Levit. xi. various
kinds of animals are prohibited as unclean3 but it is the
fixed opinion of all Divines, that that was done, not on ac-
count of any natural uncleanness, but either on account of
a moral signification, or for an express distinction of the
Jewish church from other nations. The antients for the
most part follow that moral signification in their commen-
taries3 and shew in the several animals prohibited, the de-
praved affections and habits that are to be avoided. Thus
Origen, Hom. 7, in Levit. So Tertullian. De cibis Judaic,
from whom it will not be wearisome to quote a few words3
