140 AN EXPOSlTloN οι· s'r. PAUL's Chap. i.

We have seen the nature and necessity of patience and
long-suffering: Now let us ponder the fruit and admirable
effects. And this is first to be premised‚ that the benefits
which arise from afflictions, whatever they are, do not arise
but through the medium of this patience: therefore they
are the rather to be ascribed to patience than to that afflic-
tion, which is most hurtful 10 those who are impatient.

1. Patience discomfits and overthrows all its enemies,
without inflicting or returning a wound3 it does not deign
to aim a weapon at them, nevertheless it achieves a con-
quest even by quietude. The lzeatlzen and their idolatries,
says Augustine, Epist. 42, are overcome not by resistance, but
by the martyrdom of Christians.

2. Patience causes all its enemies to serve itself, and
contribute innumerable advantages: to say nothing of the
rest, it occasions its persecutors to prepare for it the crown
of the eternal kingdom. Blessed are they who suffer perse-
cution for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom (ff
heaven, Matt. v. 10. Whence that saying of the martyr
vicentius to Dacian his tormentor, Never Izatk any one so
well served me as thou hast.

3. Our patience confounds the devii, causes angels to
rejoice, glorifies God himself, and, lastly, sometimes melts
and converts the most inveterate enemies. Tertuffian,
captivated by the great advantage of this good, exclaimed‚
De patient : Let me lose all the world, provided I am enrz'clzecl
by patience*

Witlcjoyfitlness] These last words determine the cha-
racter of true and christian patience3 for hereby it is dis-
tinguished from that which is philosophical and hypocriti-

¹¹ N ext to the displays of this grace as given by the primitive Christians,
and the martyrs at the time of the Reformation‚ the conduct of the Wal-
denses under their severe and long protracted persecutions‚ affords the
most instructive illustrations of its excellence and advantage on a large
scale. Vide ‘⁶ Authentic details of the Wafflenses, collected during a resi-
dence among the Vaudois of Piedmont and VVirtemberg, in 1825‚” Hat-
chards; a volume, it is apprehended, not sufficiently known on account of

its unpretending merits, and the profits of which are intended for the bene-
fit of the Vaudois.
