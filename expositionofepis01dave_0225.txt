Ver. ll. EPISTLE To THE conossrANS. 139

6, 7, God will render to every one according to his deeds ; to
those who endure, the glory of good worlcs.

Now let us observe what relates to long-szffiring ; nor is
there less necessity for this:

First, by reason of the promised good3 for hope which is
deferred afflicts the soul, Prov. xiii. 12. There is need there-
fore of long-suffering to those to whom the blessedness of
heaven is promised, lest they grow remiss, and, through
despair of the reward, cast off the exercise of godliness.
For the flesh murmurs and rebels, and accuses God of de-
lay and slackness‚ because he does not immediately con-
fer what he promised z but this spiritual long-suffering says,
For yet α little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will noc carry. Heb. x. 37. v

Secondly, there is need of long-suffering, by reason of
the incumbent evils. For that which Epicurus was wont
to say consoles not the godly z All grief, ij long, is light;
{f heavy, is short ‚³³³ for their afflictions are both heavy and
protracted: The whole of their life is a warfare; all this
life is to them a vale of tears. Ye shall weep ond lament,
says Christ, John xvi. 20, but the world shall rejoice. Where,
then, is the comfort of the godly? In qm‘etness and in con—
fidence shall be your strength; as Isaiah beautifully says,
cap. xxx. 15. And Jerome, Lanient. iii. 25, 26, The Lord
is good anto them that waitfor him. Ιί is good that a man

should silently waitfor the salvation of God.†

³¹⁵ The Philosopher, whose maxim is here cited, the Leader of a Sect
well known by the name of ‘ Epicureans‚' flourislied about three hundred
years before Christ3 he maintained notions respecting the gods which bor-
dered on Atheism3 and made pleasure the end of his doctrine. His follow-
ers became divided into two kinds, the rigid and the remiss; the latter il-
lustrated the leading principle of the system abundantly in their practice.
It was such who said, ‘⁶ Lot usteat and drink, sor to-morrow we ᾱὶε,” and
against the spread of whose pernicious errors the Apostle directed that
pungent corrective, 1 Cor. xv. 33: “ Be not deceived; evil communications
corrupt good ‘manners .· awalse to righteousness [md sin not, for some have not the
knowledge of God.” How could such offer any consolation to the afflicted
and miserable !

the Vulgate.
