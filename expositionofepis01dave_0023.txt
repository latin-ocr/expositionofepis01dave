bears his name. His change, however, was very graduah but
appears to have been hastened by the publication, in Holland, of
the Aurea Armilla os Perkins, a very powerful supralapsarian
divine ofi the Church of England. This alteration of opinion
would not have led to any serious consequences, had Armi-
nius, and the moderate part of the Church, been left to them-
selves. The fundamental point of Justification by faith, with the
doctrine of assurance, and even of final perseverance, were held
by him to his death ; and his exemplary piety and humility secur-
ed sor him the attachment even of those who, when the dispute
subsequently extended‚ became his most zealous opponents. The
heat, however, of the less discreet part of the Church, and the
dangerous opinions of some who leaned to the Socinian and Pela—
gian heresies, (among whom may be designated Episcopius, Gro-
tius, Limborch, Sec.) being, as is no uncommon case at present„
confounded with the tenets of Arminius, led to angry and uncha-
ritable controversies, by which the peace of the Church was grie-
vously broken in upon Still, the questions might have been
amicably settled, but that, at the annual Meetings of the Synods,
in 1605, the Class of Dort unwisely fanned the embers into a
flame by transmitting the following grievance to the University of
Leyden :—“ lnasmuch as rumours are heard that certain contro-
“ versies have arisen in the Church and University of Leyden,
“ concerning the doctrine of the Reformed Churches, this Class
“ has judged it necessary that the Synod should deliberate. respect-
“ ing the safest and most speedy method of settling those contro-
“ versies; that all the schisms and causes of offence which spring
‘⁶ out of them may seasonably be removed, and the union of the
“ Reformed churches preserved inviolate against the calumnies of
“ adversaries.''

When this officious document reached Leyden, it gave offence
to the moderate men of both sides; and met with the following
reply from the Professors there: “ that they wished the Dort
‘⁴ Class had, in this affair, acted with greater discretion‚ and in
“ a more orderly manner; that, in their own opinion, there were
“ more disputes among the Students than was agreeable to them
⁴‘ as Professors3 but, that among themselves, the Professors of
‘⁴ Theology, no difference existed that could be considered as
“ affecting, in the least, the fundamentals of doctrine; and that
“ they would endeavour to diminish the disputes among the
“ Students.’' This was signed by Arminius, then Rector of the
University‚ by Gomarus, and others.
