310 AN EXPOSITiON or s'r. PAUL’S Chap. i.

the necessary means of salvation. For since the revelation
of a Mediator is absolutely necessary for salvation, and yet
no provision was made for the revelation or knowledge of
this Mediator for so many generations of mankind 3 either
their assertion is false, or the Providence of God defective.
For, as Augustine truly observes, De civit. lib. 13. cap. 47,
Sal‘calion is not to be granted to any man except to him to
whom llas been rcvealed, by tlze will (gf God, the one Mediator
between God and man—Christ Jesas.

2. That notion of the Schools is also of very dubious
import, viz. That there is 710 man wlzo does the best in leis
power to whom God will not revcal what z's necessaryfor his sal-
vation, Durand. lib. Q. As is also this, lib.3‚ which is nearly
akin to it: If a man lives well according to the law qf'natare,
God will supply what is necessary jor lzis salvacion. Both
these axioms of the Schools are faulty in two respects:
First, in the supposition that a man in his natural corrupt
state either is able to live well, or to seek after grace.
Secondly, in the supposition that a revelation of saving
grace is due to those natural works and exertions. Pros-
per had learnt better things when he said, Ad capit. Gall.
resp. 8, It z's tlte part of impiety to teaclc that tlte grace by
wlziclc we are saved, is conjerred upon as as the reward ofoar
good works, oris withheld from *as by reason of oar bad ones.

Lastly, as the. will of God was the only acknowledged
cause why the Gospel, after being concealed for so many
ages, was afterwards manifested to the whole world3 so
the same will of God is the cause of its being known effec-
tually to the saints3 and of its striking on the ears of the
reprobate without fruit. So Paul states in this very pas-
sage, It is vzade wmaffesc to his saints, to whom God would
make it known. So also testified the Saviour himself, Matt.
xi. 25, I tlzauk thee, O Fatlzer, Lorcl qs heaven ancl earth,
because thou lzast hid these things from the wisc and prudent,
and least revealed them anto babes. Even so, FaUzer, for so it
seemed good in ΠΨ sight. This will of God in the effectual
illumination of the elect is operativae, and, as the School-
men express it, has respect to his intention 3 and therefore
performs what he approves. But the case is very different
