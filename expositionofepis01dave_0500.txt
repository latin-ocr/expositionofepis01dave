414< AN EXPOSlTloN OF ST. PAUL'S Chap. ii.

Ianswer, that the whole Divine nature was inc-amate,
not because it is incarnate in all the persons, but because
none of the perfectior] of the Divine. nature is wanting to
the Person of the Son. For since the Divine nature, or
essence, is spiritual, it can neither be supposed nor allow-
ed to have parts 3 but wherever the Divine nature is found,
there it is found entire and perfect. The whole Divine na-
ture, therefore, was incarnate, but not as considered abso-
lutely and in itself common to all the Persons, but as it is
considered in its persona] properties, or mode of being,
limited in the person of the Son. God entire, is one person,
says Lnther, tom. 2.

But against this, that saying of Augustine, in Enchir.
cap. 38, is urged3 The worlcs (f the Trinity are inclivisible:
therefore, if the second person assumed and adapted the
human nature to himself for a dwelling, then both the
Father and the Holy Spirit did the same, and, by conse-
quence, not the Son alone, but the three persons are incar-
nate.

I answer, to assume flesh imports two things: the act
itself, or the uniting of this flesh3 and the end of this act,
viz. the person to whom this flesh is united and adapted.
As regards the act, it is common to the three persons3 for
the Father and the Holy spirit jointly effected the incarna-
tion of Christ. But as regards the end, it is peculiar to
the Son alone. As, for instance, if a father gives a wife
to his son, but the son himself marries her, both are
rightly said to have contracted the marriage3 yet With this
differenceâ€š that the father married the bride to the son,
and the son married her to himself3 sn, in the incarnation
of Christ, both effected this conjunction of the human na-
ture with the Divine3 but yet so, that God the Father
joined this flesh to his Son, the Son took it to himself.
As, therefore, in the former example, not the father, but
the son is said to be married, although the will and the ac-
tion of both concurred in choosing and taking that wife:
so in this latter, not the Father, but the Son only is said
to be incarnate, although both concurred in creating and
uniting this body. And what is affirmed respecting the
