1352 AN exrosvrloN or ST. PAUL's Chap. ii.

once knew a pious man, vexed and harassed by douth,
even in the article of faith3 who, neverffieless, at the last,
was led to such a light of truth and assurance, that no
trace of wavering dwelt in his mind3 nor, indeed, did he
doubt more of that than he did of his own existence. He
adds, moreover, that this assurance did not spring from any
new reasonings or demonstrations, but from humility, and
the captivation of his intellect‚ and some wonderful illn-
mination of God from the eternal hills. Worldly men do
not believe that such illuminations do occur, and that such
afull assurance is impressed on the minds of the faithful ς·
bnt the godly, who constantly persevere in the Gospel,
have experienced them. The Apostle requires this un-
doubting persuasion in the doctrine of saith, Ephes. iv. 14.-

carried about, διο.

Hence we learn,

1. The faith of a Christian man ought not to depend
upon others, but be settled in the believer by the efficaoy
of the Spirit3 so that if prelates and ecclesiastics, nay,
even the whole world, should depart from sound saith, yet
should every one of the laity hold to the received saith. If
we, or (m angel from heaven slzozdd preaclz unco you any other
Gospel tlzan that με lzctve received, let lzz‘m be accursed : Gal.
i. 9.

2. Hence it is evident how greatly Romanists err, who
think that the assurance of our saith lies enshrined in the
papal breast of the Pope3 not for every one in his own
breast. Now it is most certain, that the determination of
a Pope cannot give fall assurance to my heart3 but the
operation of the spirit both can, and is accustonied to do
so, in the case of true believers. lee auoiming which με

ii. 27.

3. Their complaint also is unjust, who aver, that we
cannot now arrive at assurance in matters of saith, since
Christians are separated into different sects, and there are
divisions and controversies every where. Notwithstanding
