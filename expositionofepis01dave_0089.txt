An Apostle] This is a title of office or dignity. It de-
notes, if we regard the origin of the terni, any man what-
ever sent by another with a commission3 for it is derived
fron] the Greek αποστελλεινε but if we attend to the common
application of it, it denotes certain select ambassadors of
Christ. But, as Thomasss says, in terms we must regard

not so much from wlcat they are derived, as to what purpose
intended.

The name, then, of Apostle, according to the use of
sacred Seripture, belongs to those only, First, who had
received an immediate call from God to preach the Gospel:

† The characters referred to in this section were either illustrious
Fathers of the Christian Church who flourished in the third, fourth, and
fifth centuries; or eminent writers of their day, whose productioris have
gained them celebrity and become standing authority. Augustine, Eusebius,
and Chrysostom were Bishops of the early Christian Church; the former of
Hippo, in Africa3 the second of Caesarea, and the third of Constantino-
ple. This latter acquired the surname of Chrysostom, on account of his
singular eloquence, the term meaning “ golden mouth-’⁹ He was an ad-
mired rhetorician and orator, and the praises of Paul were a fine subject for
his powers to descant upon. Eusebius became celebrated by his numerous
writings, but especially as an early historian of the Church of Christ.
Jerome was particularly distinguished as a man os profound learning and
extensive information ; he was an able critic and a voluminous writer; the
author of the Latin version of the Scriptures commonly termed theVulgate‚
and from which Davenant in this Exposition generally cites his Scripture
authorities. The Nicephorus referred to, is Nicephorus Callistus, a M onk
of Constantinople of the fourteenth century, who wrote, in Greek, an
Ecclesiastical History, in 23 books, 18 of which are still extant, containing
the transactions of the Church from the birth of Christ to the death of Pho-
cas, in 610. It was considered of such worth as to be translated into Latin

by John Langius, and attained such celebrity as to have passed through
several editions.

‡ Our Author means Thomas Aquinus, whom he often cites, sometimes
under one name, sometimes the other.
