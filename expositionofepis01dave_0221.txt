Ver. ll. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 135

Paul when writing to the Ephes. iii. 16, May God grant
you, that με may be strengtheued mighstz‘ly by his Spirit in tlte
vener man.

We are here taught

l. That no one ought to confide in his own strength, as
though by his own power he could resist temptations, or
endure griefs and afflictions for Christ3 but he should seek
strengthening from this Spirit. Piously and wisely spake
Augustine, A presumption of stability keeps back many from
stability: no one will be strong by God, bnt lze wizo perceives
his wealcuess in himself, De verbis Domini. serm. 13.

2. That when temptations are overcome, it behoves us
to ascribe the glory to God, not to ourselves, or to our own
power. Not meto us, not unto us, but to thy name give tlte
glory, Ps. cxv· 1. For it is a species of pride when any
one would seem to have that from himself which he bor-
rowed from another.

Lastly, when we see heretical and impious men confi-
dently undergoing pains and torments, we mustknow, that
it is not might, but madness3 not strength, but stupidity:
for true courage is the gift of the Holy spirit, and is given
to the sanctified alone. For the things which seem to be
done by heretics and the wicked with a certain fortitude,
argue not so much their strength, as the violent impulses
of the devil : for the deeds of lzeretics are as the deeds of dce-
mom'aCS, as says Parisiensis, De moribus.

Thus it appears whence this strengthening might comes.
Let us enquire why it is called glorious.

Clamas] The Apostle could have said, we are streng-
thened by God, or by his power3 but he adds this epithet‚
glorz‘ous power, or glorz‘ous mz'glzt ;

1. That we may place the greater confidence in this
divine power: Because this very word contains in itself an
earnest, or rather a promise of victory and triumph: for
this could not be glorious power, if it might be overcome
by an evil spirit and sin. In all these tlzmgs we are more
tlzan conquerors tlirouglz lzz‘m who laath loved m, Rom viii.
