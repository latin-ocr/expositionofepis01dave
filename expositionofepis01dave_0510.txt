424 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL's Chap.ii.

1. In Christ we have perfect wisdom3 because by the
right knowledge of him, according to the doctrine of the
Gospel, what is sufficient to salvation is known : This is lffe
eternal, to know thee the only true (ι’ od and Jesus Christ whom
tlzon hasl sent, John xvii 3. Hence the Apostle (l Cor. ii.
2) desired lo know nothing but Clu-ist and him crucg‘fied. For
that which is full admits nothing beyond. Hence the mind
filled with Evangelical knowledge, desires not any new
knowledge in order to salvati0n3 because this is consum-
mate. full, and perfect doctrine. Ι admire the fnlness of
Scripture, says Tertullian, adversus Hermogenem. HEAR
Hm ! I will hear thoroughly ,· norwill l hear any one bessdes

2. In Christ we have complete righteousness; because
he has fully satisfied both the Divine law, and even God
himself for our sins t according to that declaration of Isaiah
(liii. 11) By the knowledge of himself shall my righteons ser-
vantjustgfes many,f0r he shall bear their iniquities,· and of
the Apostle, Rom. iii. 22, The righteousness ο] God by faith,
os Jesns Christ is unco all and upon all them that believe; and
Rom. x. 4, Christ z's the end of the law for rfghteousness to

with his. Chrysostom, Hom. 17. in lO ad Rom. observes,
T hat if thou shall believe in Christ, thou hast bothfulfilled the
law, and much more than the things which it had commanded ;
forasmuch as thou least truly received much greater righteous-

* Hilary, a Christian prelate of the fourth century, one of the early fa-
thers of the Church, born at Poictiers, of which city, after his conversion
from heathenism,heeventually' becamethe Bishop in 355. His zeal in favour
of the Athanasian doctrine respecting the Trinity, which he defended with
much energy at Bezieres, drew on him the persecution of the Arian party,
with Saturninus at its head, who prevailed ou the Emperor Constantius to
exile him into Phrygia. After four years spent in banishment, he was per-
mitted to return to his See, where he occupied himself in committing the
arguments for his side of the question to writing, and produced a work on
the Trinity in 12 books, which has been much celebrated. He continued

to distinguish himself as an active servant of the Church till his death, 111
367.
