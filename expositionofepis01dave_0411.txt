Ver.28. Ems‘rLE To THE cotossrANs. 325

Neither is the endeavour of the Ministry, in drawing
those to Christ who will never come, vain. In the first
place, because, whilst they are performing their duty, they
are relieving their own consciences. Secondly, because,
though the exertions of the ministry in behalf of the re-
probate, fail of their intended effect, they abundantly
answer their purpose in all those fore-ordained to salvation.
Lastly, because by this means infidels and reprobates will
be condemned in the day of judgment, and deprived of
every excuse for their sins; having disobeyed the calling
through the perverseness of their own evil affections.—-And
thus far as to Paul's intention.

Now (in the last place) let us consider Christian per-=
fection. ’

The Schoolmen hold two sorts of perfectiori 3 one of the
way, the other of the country, to which the way leads. In
this passage the Apostle has the former more particularly
in view; and this is the first point to which the Ministers
of the Gospel endeavour to lead their people, that by means
of it they may be brought to the attainment of the second.

This perfectiori of the way may also be considered in a
twofold manner. For a man is called perfect who is in
possession of every thing which is necessary for a state of
salvation; and so every believer is perfect. A man is call-

and virtue; and in this sense no man is perfect: for every
Christian always may be, and ever ought to be, growing
vand advancing in grace and holiness.

But what constitutes the character of Christian perfec—
tion'? The Apostle seems to insinuate the answer by add-
ing in Christ Jesus ‚· chat we may present every man perfect in
Christ Jesus. When, confessing our own imperfection and
corruption, we take refuge ‘in Christ, and by faith lay hold
of his perfection‚ and are renewed by the Holy Spirit into
his likeness, then, and not till then, are we perfect in Christ
Jesus. The Apostle, therefore, does in effect say, that he
labours, by preaching the Gospel, to impress true faith and
eurnest piety on the hcarts of all men,
