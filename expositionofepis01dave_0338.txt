‘252 AN EXPOSlTloN or ετ. PAUL'S Clzap. i.

2. lee mind being intent upon wiclced worlss, Tu* διανόια ἐν
τοῖς Ἔργοις τὸις πονηρὸις; i. e. the mind cleaving to, or existing in
evil worlcs. For the mind is said to be in that thing which
it always meditates upon, to which it is borne, and in-
clined by its desire 3 as the mind of a hungry man is said
το be in the dish, so the mind of the wicked is said to be
in wicked works. I conceive with the learned Beza, that
this is the genuine sense of the words, although they are
taken in a different meaning by other interpreters. Here,
therefore, the Apostle shews the cause of the emnity be-
tween God and men who are not yet called, as the Colos-
sians vvere aforetime, namely, that corruption and depra-
vity inherent in the mind, and breaking forth and shewing
itself in wicked works3 according to that declaration of
God concerning the fall of man, Gen. vi. 5, Every thought
{gf lzis hear-t is only θυι] conliuually.

This corruption of the human mind is perceived in the
understandfflg, the will, and also in the inferior faculties
and the affections.

1. The understanding is clouded by the darkness of ig-
norance. Whence that assertion of the Apostle concern-
ing the Gentiles, Ephes. iv. 18, Havz'ng the underslanding
darkened, &a Hence the worship of devils prevailed for
true religion among almost all nations3 hence they com—
mitted many abominable things without sha111e‚ as the
Apostle amply states, Rom. i. That this blindness of the
understanding is ajust cause of Divine hatred, is evident
from the Divine nature: for God is light, and iu. Ιιὶηι is ηο
darkness at all, l John i. 5. And according to the primary
law of creation, man was made in the likeness of God.

2. As to the will, it is infected with the poison of wick-
edness3 which was not unknown to philosophers themselves.
For Plato, in his Sophiste, expressly asserts, that the mind
of every man labours under two diseases; ignorance and
wickedness. Hence that observation in Job xv. 16, Abomin-
able andfilthy is man ; he drinloeclz in iniquity as water. The
many adulteries, thefts, murders‚ and wickedness of every
kind openly committed by men, do but too plainly prove
this inward perversion of the will. W'e have here there-
fore, in the human mind, another cause of this emnity.
