526 AN nxposrrmn or ST. PAUL’s Clmp.ii.

The instructions are these :

1. When any thing is proposed to us for observance,
the nature of the thing itself is to be considered: if the
observatiou consist in bodily and transitory things, such
as in food, raiment. or the like, we ought not to suppose
that the immediate worship of God, righteousness, or ho-
liness consists therein.

2. Commandments of this kind, therefore, if they are
prescribed by those who have legitimate authority, and
that in a legitimate manner, they must be received in that
sense, that they wish them to be observed, either for the
sake of external order, or as far as they may be referred
and directed to some nseful end : not that they are parts of
Divine worship in themselves, or that by the performance
of the work itself, they add to our righteousness, holiness,
or merit with God,

3. If sometimes those observances which consist in
these transitory things are violated, provided contempt and
scandal be shunned‚ the soul is not defiled by the inere act
of omission, or involved in deadly guilt3 because (as we
have before shewn) the nature of these things is not of a
kind to reach to the sanctification or defilexnent of the
soul.

4. Hence we gather the error and folly of the Monks,
who think that they are more perfect and holy than all
other moi-tals, because they have bound themselves tov ab·
stain from certain external things which they could lawfully
use, as, for instance, from meats, from elegant clothing,
from the private possession of goods, &c.; whereas, all
these are of the number of earthly and corruptible things,
by the use of which, in itself‚ no one can be defiled or
rendered worse 3 and by the abstnining from which, no one
can be made more righteous or holy.

5. Whatever is worthy of praise in abstaining from these
indifferent things, or in the use of the same, when they are
prescribed by men endowed with authority, the whole
depends, not on the nature of the things themselves (for
they are earthly and corruptible), neither on the work or
action itself, hut upon the mind of the person obeying,
