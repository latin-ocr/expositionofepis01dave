l. We shall shew that true philosophy is not condemn-
ed by the Apostle.

2. We shall explain what we ought to understand under
the word philosophy in this place.

3. We shall shew wherein the use, wherein the abuse
of philosophy consists‚ as far as relates to divine matters.

1. As to the first 3 Whether we speak concerning moral
or natural philosophy, whether concerning any other branch
of philosophy, oros the whole as a certain entire body ;
it is certain that that cannot be condemned, lest God him-
self be called intojudgment. For philosophy is the off-
spring of right reason: and this light of reason is infused
into the human mind by God himself, according to that re-
mark of Tertullian, Reason is (ff God. We, therefore‚judge‚
not the discipline of the Stoicks, nor Platonists, nor Aris-
toteliam, to be true philosophy: but whatever among all
these, or others, shall have been discovered, spoken, or
written, by the light of right reason; all this taken toge-
ther we callplzilosophes. Therefore, not the dreams of phi-
losophers constitute philosophy, but the principles of every
one, which agree with truth and good morals. For as the
errors of Theologians do not pertain to theology as parts
of it, but as disease3 so neither do those of Philosophers
pertain to philosophy. We seruple not, therefore, to call
philosophy, with Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom. 1, α mor-
sel os eternal truth. They, therefore, who desire philosophy
itself to be exploded from the schools of Christians, are
either altogether ignorant, and have it in view to hide their
ignorance among the common ignorance of all; or they are
wic-ked, and desire to expose us stripped of all advantage
from learning, untaught and defenceless, to artful and
aimed eneinies; which wicked purpose of Julian, Nazian-
zen discovers and reproveS, Orat. l. in Julianum.

I might in this place speak of the various advantages of
physics, ethics, and logie. For not only does common
life derive assistance froin all these, but even divine Theo-
logy, by the admission of Tei-tullian, a bitter enemy of
philosophers 3 In what way could (my one he trained to human
prudence, 01· lo any astitui whatever, u-iihout learning, since
