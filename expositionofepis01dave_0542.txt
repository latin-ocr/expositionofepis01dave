creatures. God alone could impart animal or corporeal life
to this fragment of earth3 he alone, therefore, can impart
spiritual life to earthly and carnal man. It is a greater work
to quicken an ungodly man dead in sins, than to create
heaven and earth. For whether we are quickened by the
forming again of the image which we have lost, or by the ’
removal of the guilt which we have incurred, either opera-
tion is the work of God. He quic-kens the soul by renew-
ing it, and by cleansing away the filth of sin: For we are
his worlcmauslzip created in C lzrist Jeszts unto good works,
Ephes. ii. 10. He also quickens the soul (which the Apos-
tle has especial respect to in this place) by taking away
the deadly guilt of our sin. For we were dead, inasmuch
as the sentence of death was passed against us by reason
of our sins : we are said to be quickened, inasmuch as this
sentence is done away through the death of Christ, and we
are delivered from the guilt of punishment, and reconciled
to God. Hence,

l. We may learn the eternal love of God the Father to·
wards uS‚ who is not so averse to us wretched mortals dead
in sins, but that he vouchsafes to quicken and revive us
from the death of sin. We shudder to touch the dead bo-
dies of our friends: but God is not only ready to touch
our dead souls, but to embrace them3 and not only that,
but would even restore them to life. This should inflame
us with mutual love towards God.

2. Let us consider the infinite guilt of sin, which could
not be acquitted, except by the death of the Son of God
for oursins‚ and his being raised again for our justification.
For this the Apostle intimates, when he sayS‚ lze leatlz quick-
ened us together with Christ. He delivered Christ to death,
then he quickened him, that he being quickened, we,
through, and on his account, might be restored to spiritual
life. That was, doubtless, deadly siu, which could not be
expiated but by the death of Christ: we were dead indeed,
who could not be quickened otherwise than by the life of
the Son of God. This should excite us to hatred of and
avoiding sin.
