Ver. 20. ErisTLE To THE coLossmNs. 243

suitable, because it especially excites to the love of (iod,
to hatred of sin, and to the practice of godliness.

But now it remains for us to shew why he chose to suf-
fer this ,ignominious death of the cross; for both in this
place, and frequently elsewhere, this is urged by the Apos-
tle, as in Phil. ii 8, He became obedient welo death, even the
death of tlze cross. This kind [of death] not only serves to
aggravate his sufferings, but also to confirm our saith.

l. This kind of death shews that Christ took upon him-
self the curse which was due to us, and freed us from the
same ε for God hath therefore pronounced the death of the
cross accursed, Dent. xxi. 23, because he had determined
for our deliverance to inflict this shameful kind of death
upon his Son. The words of the Apostle, Gal. iii. 13, refer
to this3 Christ ΙιαῐΙι redeemed us from the curse (ff the lan
being made α cursefor us: As it is wriClen, Cursed z's every one
that leangetlz on a tree.

2. Because this kind of death corresponded to many
types and figures. For the sacrifices which prefigured
Christ were placed upon wood, and were raised aloft before
they were burnt. The brazen serpent, suspended upon a
pole, shadowed forth, according to Christ’s own interpre-
tation, his crucifixion ς As Illoses liftecl up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son (ψ’ Man be lefled up, John
iii. 14. I, {f I be lifted up, will (lraw all men meto me, John
xii. 32.

3. That the pious may understand from thence, that no
kind of death for righteousness sake is shameful, or to be
dreaded by those subjected thereto. For many who by no
means dread death itself, yet shun it when coupled with
shame and ignominy: but the cross of Christ arms his
disciples against this fear; which was manifest in the niar-
tyrs, who avoided not death, however ignominious.

To these reasons we might add others from the School-
men3 which we shall only name, because they seem partly
trffling, and partly too curious.

Because Adam sinned by the fruit of the forbidden tree,
therefore this second Adam was willing to suffer punish-

ment upon the tree of the cross.
