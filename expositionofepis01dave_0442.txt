voice of Christ in the Scriptures‚ although the Roman
church, or any other visible church disclaim it. Therefore
we do not reject the external voice of the church‚ or con-
sider its ministry at all unnecessary3 but we hold that the
full assurance of thie understanding in matters of faith arises
from internal light and the testimony of the Spirit, without

imagination.

But why is the Gospel‚ or Evangelical doctrine, called
the mystery of God, and os the Father, and qf Christ? On
two accounts :

1. Because the triune God was the Author and Framer
of the doctrine of the Gospe13 and Christ was sent by the
Father as a herald and promulgator of the same. It there-
