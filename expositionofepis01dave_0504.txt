ed for by the Schoolmen, viz. that the hypostasis, or person
of Christ was compounded after the incarnation. For this
is asserted by them, not with respect to parts, as though
the person of the Word were compounded of the human
nature and the Divine, as of parts3 but with respect to
number, because that now subsists in two natures‚ which,
before the incarnation, subsisted solely in the Divine. Thus
Aquinas 3. part. qu. 2. art. 4, says, The person (ff Christ is
considered either according to what ic is in itself, and so it is<
simple5 or according to tlte matures in which it subsists, and so
itis said to be compoemd, iuasmuclz as that simple person sul}-
sists in two matures. Thus much as to the first objection.

2. It is objected‚ that to become incarnate, or to take
to itself human nature, is to be changed: but the eternal
Deity cannot be the subject of any change : therefore he
could not become incarnate, and, therefore, he does not
dwell bodily in the human nature of Christ.

We answer‚ That to be incaruate, as also to become
man, occurred to the Word not by transmutation, but by
uni0n3 which is a species of relation ε but what is predicated
anew of any subject relatively‚ does not, therefore, presup-
pose a change of the thing to which it is ascribed, but of
the other which it connects nith it. For instance3 God,
who was not a Creator from all eternity, became a Creator
in time; but yet this new appellation does not imply a
change in God, but in the creature, which is brought into
being by God from nothing: So the Son of God, who was
not man, neither incarnate from all eternity, is made man,
and becomes incarnate3 yet is not changed in himself, be-
cause a change takes place in the human nature which is
assumed, and not in the Divine which assumes. The Son
of God was not man, or incarnate, when he did not impart
personality to the human nature; he is pronounced man,
and incarnate, when he did impart personality to that na-
ture 3 but this he did, not by changing his Divine nature,
but by uniting this human nature to himself. To be made
man, imports absolutely a real change in the subject ac·-
quiring human nature, as when man is made from the earth
or seed 3 because here the subject which is made man loses
