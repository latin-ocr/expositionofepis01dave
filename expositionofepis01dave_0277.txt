Ver. 16. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 191

coming into existence, and of going out of existence, is
repugnant to every idea of eternity3 but in every thing
created there is implied this possibility of decay. These,
however, are very thorny topics, nor does an over inquisi-
tive debate concerning them belong to the Theological
chair. Justin Martyr, in his Quaestionibus, and William
of Parisfi‘= in lib. de Uuiverso, part. ii. cap. 11, may be
consulted on these subjects.

angele. For it is an admitted axiom among Divines,
that the act of creation cannot be conceded to a creature,
not even as the instrumental cause, much less as the prin· '

distance, impassable to the powers of any created thing.
Secondly, because every action of a creature is an accident3
but accident has no admission, except in a subject already
existing: therefore the creature cannot possess the crea-
tive accident3 for then it would possess an accident, when
there was nothing in which the acting power could inhere
as its subject. Finally‚ because in creation the entire
being of a thing is imparted3 but the entire being is only
imparted by Him who is entirely one act3 for a finite and
natural cause can never form any thing out of nothing.
But the authority of Scripture is sufficient for us, which
teaches that the whole fabric of the world was made, not
by the ministry of angels, -but by the power of the Word.
