who have not yet been made partakers of the riches which
the Gospel brought to light.

2. Hence we 163111 what sort of 1101163 we ought to thirst
after, and pursue even with insatiable desire3 not, forsooth,
the dirty ore dug up from the dirty earth, but those hea-
venly and spiritual treasures sent down from above. For
this grace contained in the mystery of the Gospel, is that
pearl qf great price, which a wise merchant, when he has
once seen, will immediately sell all he has in the world to
buy, Matth. xiii. 46. As, then, we should consider the
heir of some king, or other rich man, to be mad, who,
thinking nothing of all his hereditary property, employed
himself in seraping together the ordure from his father’s
stable as his riches3 so ought a similar suspicion of mad-
ness to attach to any man, who can disregard these riches
which his heavenly Father has offered him 111 the GospeI,
and give up his whole beart to seraping together gold and
silver‚ which, in comparison with the other, are to be ac-
counted as dung. Phil. iii. 8.

Lustly, from the Gospel mystery containing such great
riches, an argument may very seasonably be derived in fa-
vour of the dignity of the Gospel ministry: For what of-
fice 0311 be conceived more honourable than that of Minis-
ters, who are entrusted with the power of dispensing such
great and valuable riches? VVhoever, therefore, despises
these Ministers, does but too plainly prove his contempt of
God himself3 and, like swine, trample the Gospel 'pearl
under his feet.

Thus much 33 to the riches of this mystery.

But, as if this were too little in so great 3 matter as the
mystery of our salvation‚ the Apostle adds, that it is not
only a very rich, but also 3 very glorious mystery3 τίςὸ
’πλόυτος της δόξης, &cu What is the ric-hes (ff the gloyy. Indeed,
it is well worthy of observation‚ that not only in the verses
before us, but almost every vrhere else, when he speaks of
the riches of this Gospel mystery, he adds something about
its glorjy. Thus Rom. ix. 23, sllzat lae might malfe known the
ric-hes of leis glory, 810. Α11(1 Eph. i. 18, 116 wishes the eyes
