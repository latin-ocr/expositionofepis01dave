376 AN EXPOSITION or s‘r. PAUL's Chap. ii.

the prelates of the Church, in opposition to that direction
of the Apostle, Heb. xiii. 17, Obey them that have the rule
over you, and submit yourselves to them.

4. Order is as the fence opposed to seducers z therefore,
they seldom are plunged into errors who observe the order
of obedience due to those set over them3 on the other
hand, where the order of commanding and of obeying is
neglected‚ there a breach is easily effected, as through a
routed army. So much concerning order.†

And tlte stedfastuess of yourfaitlz in Christ] This is the
second cause of joy to the Apostle. He saw the Colos-
sians attacked hythe seducers, he saw tares every where
scattered by them3 but, at the same time, he perceived
that the faith of the Colossians could not be overcome, that
those tares were not approved by them for wheat, but were
despised and rejected3 hence that joy. This stecffastuess, or
solidity in the saith, therefore, denotes two things: first,
that they suffered not the true doctrine to be wrested from
them, but remained firm and immovable in it, like soldiers
at their post: the other, that they did not permit strange
and foreign doctrines to be mingled with it; but filled their
minds with sacred doctrine, the inventions of men being
excluded from the business of saith. For that is properly
said to be solid, which isfull (gf z'tself alone, that is, which
does not receive any thing heterogeneous into it. That is,
therefore, a stedfast saith, which not only embraces the
true doctrine, but which admits no mixture of that which
is false and foreign to it. Which, also, the Apostle him-
self afterwards intimates, when he restricts faith to Christ3
as though he would say, What they proclaim for the doc-
trines of faith without Christ, are to be rejected.

Hence we learn,
l. When the mind wavers and vacillates between va-

rious opinions, that is not a stedfast saith, but an empty

be preserved in the English Translation.
