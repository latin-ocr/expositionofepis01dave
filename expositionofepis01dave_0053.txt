rage us to patience under the cross: then we may be assured of
our predestination, and of our future possession of eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Our Author’s final work was well suited to his life and character.
It was a small volume written with a view of uniting the Evange-
lical churches3 under the title of Ad pacem Ecclesiae adhortatio,
&c. which was translated into English with the title of AnExlzor-
tation to Brotherly Love, δίς. Of this beautiful little work,
Bishop Hall, in his “ Peace-maker‚’' laying down the principles
of Church Unity, says, “ None hath so fully cleared the point, as
the late honour of our schools, the learned Bishop Davenant, in
that last Golden Tractate which he wrote, now breathing towards
the gates of his heaven3 his pious and pithy Exhortation of the
Evangelical churches to a happy peace: wherein the fundamen-
tals of our faith are so evidently laid open, that it is not hard to
judge by that unfailing rule, whom we may and must admit to the
communion of Christ's Church, and whom we ought to exclude
from that holy society.”

On the 2011] of April, 1641, Bishop Davennnt was summoned
to his rest, in the full vigour of his faculties and piety‚ at the age
of 71, having presided over the See of Salisbury twenty years.
The immediate cause of his decease was an asthma, with which
110 had been long afflicted; bnt his death is said 10 have been
hastened by the melancholy forebodings of his mind, as to the sad
prospects of the nat10n. ‘⁴ The righteous is taken away from
the evil to eome.'' He died, as it has been correctly said, at “ a
truly convenient season ; that he might neither see nor suffer those
bitter calamities which speedily overwhelmed both Church and
State Γ* and which his old friend, Dr. Ward, keenly experienced,
being persecuted with great severity for his steady adherence to
the Church and King‚ by the Puritan leaders, notwithstanding his
piety and the soundness of his doctrinal views. Similar was the
treatment also experienced by their colleague Balcanqual‚ now
Dean of Durham, who literally fell a victim to the fury of the
Puritans; being driven from all he possessed, and dying at Chirk-
castle, Denbighshire, in consequence of the severity he met with.
The like persecutions, though in aslighter degree, involved our
Author’s Nephews, Archdeacon Davenant and Dr. Fuller, whose
»benefices were sequestered. The Bishop was interred in the South
