500 As EXPOSITION or sr. PAUL’S Chap. ii.

Scripture is of no credit, says Jerom, in Cap. 1. ad Titum.
And Lactantius, Instit. lib. 3. cap. 13, observes, A man, be
he who lze may, ff he trusts in himself, that is, in α man, is
certainly arrogant, since he presumes to claim for himself what
human condition does vot admit. It is, then, above the con-
dition of man to be an absolute judge in matters of faith.
Hence estimate Romish tyranny, which has claimed to
itself for a long time this very power over all Christians.
What pleases them, either must forthwith be believed, or
they brandish their anathemas. If you require the testi-
monies of Scripture to support the saith, they say that they
arejudges of all controversieS, and of the Scriptures them-
selves; nay, that they can prescribe articles of faith from
unwritten‚traditions. But what else is this than to rule
over the churches‚ and the consciences of men in the same
manner in which umpires were accustomed to do in the
games and contests 2-Thus far concerning the first mark
of seducet-s, which they possess in common with our
Papist's.

Secondly, those seducers are reprehended and rejected,
not only because they usurped to themselves undne and il-
legal power, but also because they abused the same to de-
ceive Christians. How? Namely, whilst they exereised
them in vain worship and toil, from which they could de-
rive no profit3 and whilst they led them from the straight
course, and from the mark set before them in the word, to
their own inventions. For as a director of the games, if
he should order any one to run (as they say) without the
course, would defraud him of his prize3 because he never
would arrive by that way at the goal: so they who direct
Christians to seek salvation apart from Christ, endeavour to
beguile them oftlzeir rea-c1rd,· because they never could gain
the prize of their high calling: For we are made partalcers
(gf Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence sledsast
vnto the eud, Heb. iii. 14. Therefore, be it established, that
whoever endeavour to lead ns from the simplicity of the
Gospel and from Christ, d0, by the same effort, endeavour
to beguile us of our reward. Therefore, let them be (165-
