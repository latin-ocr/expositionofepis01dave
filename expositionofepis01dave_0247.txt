breath, and then only to be translated into the kingdom of
Christ.

The kingdom of his dear 8οης or (ff the 8οη (ῃί his love]
It remains that, in the last place, we consider well why
the Apostle calls it llze kingdom of his Son, not o] Goel, oi·
(ff heaven, or of light, as in other places.

1. Itis very aptly called the kingdom eff tlte 8οη, beo
cause God admits no one to this kingdom, be it under-
