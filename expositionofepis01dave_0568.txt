For if we look into the Sehoolmen they place the whole
argument of ecclesiastical fasting in a difference and choice
of meats, not in abstinence and moderation. Hence Hales,
part. 4. quaest. 28. memb. 3. art. 2, contends, that we are to
abstain in the time of fasting not so much from quantity as
from quality .- for he asserts, that during the time of fasting,
it is a greater sin to eat a little flesh, than to devour much
fish. And Durandus, lib. 4. dist. 7. quaest 4, writes, ΤΙιαιι
α Popislz fast is not broken by one meal, however great, pro-
vided they abstaz'nfrom tlte meats prolzibited, i. e. from flesh,
egge, and milk. Hence it comes to pass that the Papists
feel no scruple to taste wine or fish, however delicate, dur-
ing Lent, or figs, dates, and almost all other articles which
are accounted delicacies, provided they religiously take
care not to eat flesh. No wonder fasts are so pleasing to
them to whom it is holiness to fast in this manner.

But now let us meet certain doubts, which may arise
from this apostolic doctrine, concerning the abrogated

difference of meats and days,

- l. Itis objected that Christian magistrates have com-
manded abstinence from meats at certain times; and on
this account, those who violate this command are criminal‚
and may be judged: therefore, Christians are judged on
account of meats3 which seems to oppose the apostolic
conclusion, Lec 110 man thereforejudgeqzsou, διο.

It is to be answered, first, that the Apostle blames those
who introduce a difference of meats for the cause of sanc-
tity 3 viz. that so they may condemn as transgressors of the
law, those who do not observe this choice of meats: but
he blames not those who decide that, for the sake of pub-
lic utility, the one may be taken at this time, or the other
at that: so that they may offer no scruple to men’s con-
sciences, as if it were a thing unlawful in itself to do
otherwise. Secondly, we say that the magistrates them-
selves wish that laws of this kind, in which the fate of the
commonwealth is not involved, may be accepted and ob-
served qfter the manner os citizens, not rigorously; that is,
they would hare subjects to be bound not to contravene
statutes of this kind with contempt or scandal; but they
