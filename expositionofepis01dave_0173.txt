Ver. 5. EPISTLE To THE cotossmNs. 87

The word of the trulla] The Apostle distinguishes the
Gospel by a paraphrastic expression. Erasmus* translates it
the veracious word, because the genitive of a substantive
should‘be often rendered by an adjective, after the usage of
the Hebrew language. But he has not sufficiently reached
either the meaning or force of Paul's expression. For
both the doctrine os the law is the veracious word, and many
doctrines of the Philosophers are true; but tlte word of
truth, is (by way of eminence) appropriated to the Gospel.

'⁵ Erasmus, well known by his philologia-al and theological treatises as an
able scholar and useful writer; the “ Hpo'ffpoaoqss’ says Aubcry, “ of our
knowledge, and the man that made the rough and uim-otiden ways smooth
and passable.'’ He was born at Rotterdam in 1467, and educated in an ex-
cellent school at Dusseldorf, in Cleveland3 and at nineteen years of age
entered among the regularCanons of the Blonastery of Stein. From thence
he went into France, visited Paris, and studied in the College of Mon.
taigne. Obtaining there some English pupils, he was induced to visit this
country, and studied awhile at Oxford ; afterwards he travelled into Italy,
and gained great reputation. He carne again into England, on the express
invitation of Heni-y VIII., at whose Court he fiourished about the com-
mencement of the sixteenth century; and also became further distinguish-
ed by Lectures read in Greek and Theology to the students at Cambridge,
in which University he was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor about
1511, and was presented to a Prebendary by WVolsey, and afterwards to the
Rectory of Aldington, in Kent. But though thus naturalised, as it were,
here, he returned again to the Continent, and was created Counsellor to
Prince Charles of Austria. He did not, however, stay long at the Austrian
Court, but withdrew to Basil, and spent his latter days in active literary
employ with friends he had made there. He entered warmly into the affairs
of the Reformation, and in 1516 published his celebrated New Testament, in
Greek and Latin, which was received with the utmost eagerness by all those
whose minds were turned to 'l‘heological pursuits: yet there were many others
to whom the publication of the various Editions of the Scriptures by Erasmus
and his brother Reformers, and the circulation of “ ΤΗΕ wonn or THE
TRUTH'' by their means, was most offensive· It alarmed the profligate and
illiterate BIonks. They declared from the pulpit, ί that there was now a
new language discovered, called Greek, of which people should be aware,
since it was that which produced all the heresies——that in this language was
come forth a book called the New Testament, which was in every body’s
hands, and was full of thorus and briars—that there was also another lan-
guage started up, called Hebrew, and that they who learnt it became
Jews !' Resides such efforts to promote learning, Erasmus built a
School at Rotterdain, endowed it, and directed the order of the Institution.
But it is unnecessary to dwell upon his life, though full of interest and in-
cident3 it has been written at length by different hands, besides the prin.
