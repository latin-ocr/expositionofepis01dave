6 AN EXPOSITION OF ST. PAUL's Chap.i.

ful in the [κη-(Ζ, l Cor. iv. 173 most learned in the Scrip-

commendatioris. But in this place he calls him Brother,
either on account of his agreement in religion and true

you know these Scriptures to have proceeded from men
inspired by Divine illumination, and not from impostors?
I answer: This principle applies to all other things, That
