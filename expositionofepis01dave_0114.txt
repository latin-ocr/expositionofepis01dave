23 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ST. PAUL’s Chap. i.

and in Christ among the children of God3 or, lastly, on
account of our being grafted into one mystical body;
Christ is the Head of this body.

Hence we learn, that there is no sanctity, or faith, or
brotherhood of any avail to salvation, unless it be ground·-
ed in Christ. For Jews, Mahometans, Heretics, have a
certain sanctity of their own, a saith of their own, and also
a brotherhood of their own ε but all these they have apart
from Christ. A Jew wishes to be sanctg'fied; but by the rites
of Moses, not by the blood of Christ. A Mahometan
wishes to be accounted saitlzsul; yet not in Christ, but the
most wicked impostor Mahomet. A Papist wishes to be a
brother ,· but a Fraciscan, a Dominican, and any thing
rather than a Christian brother; which name among them
is base in comparison with those novel fraternities.

And thus far as to the Inscription.

Here the Translator must be permitted to observe‚ if
such be the doctrine of the GospeL as hath been thus
shewn by our Expositor—if such the obligations entailed
and required by Baptism‚ and by our taking upon us the
Christian name through that sacramental rite3 then, from
what have we fallen in the last century? What have mul-
titudes in this Christian country been doing3 in reviling
the saints of God and pouring contempt upon that holy
Name3 plunging into all the. pomps and vanities they
pledged themselves to renounce3 abandoning their first
principles and plainest duties3 breaking the unity of the
household of faith 3 neglecting the service of God 3 and so,
bringing into contempt the Religion to which they had
sworn subjection, and which they ought to have cherished,
adorned, and promoted to the utmost of their power! And
if these things have constituted the national guilt of this
Country‚ can any wonder that God should have permitted
us to be subjected to our enemies, and exposed again to

the influence, and perhaps, the domination of Infidelity
and Popery?
