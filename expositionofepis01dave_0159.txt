saints are more to be loved by us than others, viz. because
that which is the formal reason of love, is more visible in
them than others: For as those objects are better seen,
which are placed more in the light, because light is the
formal object of visi0n3 so those men are more loved, who
are more united to God, because God is the formal and
proper object of love.

The last object of love Augustine makes to be, rlze lm-

⁸ Bede, justly named the Venerable, was born about the year A.D. 670,
in the country between the mouth of the WVare and the Tyne. His works
make eight folidvolumes, and consist principally of Commentaries on the
Scriptum, chiefly drawn from the Fathers: and abounding with allegorical
interpretations. From his writings it is evident that he had acquired all
the learning, philosophical and theological, that could be attained. His
information, surprising as it may seem for a person in this country, at that
age, had been derived from his access to a library collected at the Monastery
atJarrow, by Benedict Biscop, a Monk who had been encouraged under
Alfrid, King of N orthumberland‚ to collect books in France and Italy.
The volumes he got together contained the concentrated wisdom of ages;
and from these treasures were Bede's productions gathered. His most va-
lnable work is his Ecclesiastical Histoi-y, which, though abounding in le-
gendary fabies, the natural result of the credulity of the age and the sources
of his resort, is an inestimable record of the early history of the Anglican
Church.-Mr. Southey in his Vindiciae Ecclesiae Anglicanae, has given a
very interesting view of the character and productioris of this eminent and
holy man. He was employed at the period of his dissolution, and during
a long and painful illness, in dictating to Wilberth‚ a young disciple, a
translation of St. John's Gospel. Just as this was being brought to a close,
he said, ‘⁶ It is now time that I should be released, and go to Him who
created me. l have lived long and my mercif'ul Judge hath ordered my
ways well. The hour of my freedom is at hand; and my soul desires to
behold Christ in his glory.” The young disciple then said to him, “ Blas-
ter, there is yet one sentence more.'' “ WVrite quickly, then‚'' replied the
adoring saint. Presently Wilberth said, “ Now it is done.” ‘⁶ Yon have
said truly,'' rejoined the dying inan ε “ It is finished. 'Pake my head be·
tween thy hands. and place me so that I may look towards my oratory, and
then call upon my Father.” Being then laid on the pavement‚ in the posi-
tion which he directed, he expired presently, chaunting the doxology with
his latest breath.
