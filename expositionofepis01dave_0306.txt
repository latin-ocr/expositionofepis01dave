220 AN ExposrriON or ετ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

is ‘not α true member sofar as answers the character qs a mem-
ber, but he z's a true member asfar as regards the character qf
cm instrument. This is mere trifling ! For nothing can be
understood of which the formal cause is denied3 neither
does the genus determine the species.

3. Those whom the Church itself would not acknow-
ledge as members or its parts, if it knew what they are,
Christ, who knows all thingS‚ does not acknowledge.
Nay, Bellarmin asserts, cap. 10, that the Church intends
only to collect the faithful, and ff she knew the wz'clced and un-
bele'evz'ng, she either never would admit them, or, if they acci-
dentally were admitted, she would cast them out. Who, then,
in his senses would affirm, that the wicked and unbelievfflg,
whom Christ would condemn, and whom the Church, if she
knew them to be such, would cast out, are true members of
Christ, and of the Catholic Church ‘3

4. The Church which is the body of Christ, hath no
member which doth not receive a vital influx from the head:
for (as we have before shewn) the same Spirit is diffused
from the head to all the members: He who hath not the Spi-
rt't (gf Christ is none of his, Rom. viii. 9. But infidels, and
the wioked have not this vitality of grace flowing from the
head. That which Bellen-min is compelled to answer is
childish 3 viz. Although they have neither an internal
union with the head, nor an influx of grace, yet they have
external union, which suffices to constitute them true
members of the Church, i. e. of the body of Christ. This
subterfuge is vain: for (as Aquinas rightly speaks, quaest.
disp. de grat. Christi. art. 7. ad. Ilm.) Christ and his true
members are one mysticat person, whence the deeds qs Christ,
the head, are z'n Some manner those os the member-s .· But that
external union neither makes a man one person with Christ,
nor a partaker of the obedience and righteousness of Christ ς
therefore it does not make him a member of Christ.

5. The same man is not at the same time a member of
Christ and of the devii: but wioked men are numbered
amongst the servants and the children of the devil, John
viii. 38 and 443 therefore they are not to be reckoned among

the members of Christ.
