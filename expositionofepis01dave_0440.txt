in the collier who professed that he believed what the
church believed, and the church believed what he himself
held, whilst he was ignorant all the time what either the
church or he himself heldat But the true faith has-full as-
surance of tlze understandiwg; this implicit and blind faith
has not a grain of understanding.

its believers, or some such external motive, while he is in
the mean time without that internal light in which the
mind beholds the formal reason of its belief; such an one
has not the attribute of infused faith, but a light notion in
matters of saith. Formo one believes any thing lo be true,

merely because lze wishes to believe it is true. Picus Mirand-
