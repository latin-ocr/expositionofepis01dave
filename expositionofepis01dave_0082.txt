after those things which are the province of another,
and may be sought from Geographers. Whoever the
Colossians were, we may be firmly persuaded of this,
that the bemffit of this Epistle ought to extend to our-
selves as well as to theut*

Now, as to the occasion of the writing‚ we must
recollect that the Church of Colosse was founded z'n
purity, aud rightly instructcd in the mystery of the
Gospel by Epaphras, and other faithful Aliuisters of
the Word. But there soon sprung up ministers of
Satan, whose great aim was to obscure the Gospel, and
trouble the Church. Some of these, as though the

simplicity of the Gospel were unworthy the u‘isdom of
man, obtruded philosophical subtleties upon the Colos-

* There seems no doubt that Colosse was situated in Phrygia in the
neighbourhood of Laodicea and Hierapoli& in whose destruction it is said,
as above, to have participated. The Rev. F. Arundel, in his recent “ visit
to the seven Chnrches,’' madea point of investigating the actual scite of
Colosse, whose scanty ruins he seems to have clearly ascertained in the im-
mediate vicinity of the present Town of Khonas, which appears to have
sprung up from its ashes, for we find the Bishop of Chonae present at the
second Nicene Coum-il. The Translator cannot forbear quoting the follow-
ing interesting scene, which was presented to Mr. Arundel, when taking his
farewell of this district. “ Having crossed,'' says he, ” a small river, (pro-
bably the Asopus,) flowing down to the plain, about half past two, our
course nearly west, we were overtaken by a heavy shower, or rather a torrent,
which lasted a full half hour. Nothing could exceed the grandeur of the
scene just before the rain began to fall, and at the moment when it ceased.
On the left were the lofty peaks of Mount Cadmus, of the darkest hue,
with a few streaks of snow along their sides; clouds of a whitish colour
rolling beneath those peaks, whilst the atmospbere above thern was one mass
of condensed clouds, black as night. On the right hand was the ridge of
mount RIessogis, partly in dark shadow, and partly bright with patches of
sunshine; while the terrace on which were the ruins of Hierapolis, glit-
tered with the reflexion of the white masses of incrustation, resembling
sheets of water, or of ice falling over the edge. A rainbow of the most
vivid colours I ever beheld, with an outer one as vivid as rainbows com-
monly are, extended over the whole of the scites of Hierapolis and Laodi-
cea. This said, or seemed to say, ι Dark and gloomy as the prospect now
is, and has long been, in these once highly favoured regions, the bow of
mercy is again shining; and soon shall the rays of the Gospel-sun dispel
all recollection of the days of pagan darkness! ”
