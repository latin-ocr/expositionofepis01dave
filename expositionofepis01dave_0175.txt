Ver. 6. Eris'rnss To ‘run COLosslANS. 89

Verse 6.
Which is come ‘anso you as it is in all the world ; and bring-

k’thforthfrm't, as it doth also in you, since the day με
heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth-

Paul in the preceding verse celebrated the Gospel, inas-
much as it was the instrumental cause of producing hope
in the hearts of the Colossians: but he still advances in
his praises of the same gospel. For it is the custom of this
Apostle, having once named the Gospel, ‘forthwith to
launch out in commendation of it. Which he does the
more freely in this place, because having commended the
Gospel, both the Colossians who so readily received it,-
and Epaphras who so faithfully preached it among them,
are associated by him in that commendation.

Now let us come to the text.

In it the Apostle introduces three things: First, he
shews the diffusion of the Gospel, in particular—it is come
to you; in general—and to all the world. Secondly, he
declares its efficacy, z't bearsfl¹zcit ; where the Vulgate, and
Chrysostom also add a word which is wanting in our ver-
sions, viz. et crescit, καὶ ἀυξανόμενον, and increases. Thirdly,
he extends this efficacy from the circumstance of time,
since the day με heard, διο.

Which is come anto yon, τόὐ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς] Here the
goodness, and the love of God towards the Colossians
shines forth: For the Colossians had not come to the Gos—
pel, but the Gospel to them. The sick are vvont to seek
physicians, and to provide medicines at their own expence ς
but the heavenly Physician seeks the sick, freely sends
the medicine of the Gospel- to them who are neither look-
ing for, nor thinking of it. So the prophet, Isa. lxv. l, I
amfomzd ofthem who sought me not. And the Saviour him-
self says, Luke xix. 10, The Son of man is come to seelc, and
lo save tlzat which was lost. Upon this Cyprian observes,
De Baptismo Christi, The beloved (ff the Father loved us
