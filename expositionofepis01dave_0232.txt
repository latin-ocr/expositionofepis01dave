the Saviour himself, Matth. xxv. 34, and Luke xii. 32,

Secondly, because in time, through effectual calling, he
draws the elect to himself, who, if left to their own incli-
nation‚ would never embrace the salvation offered. No
man, says Christ, cometlz unco me, except tlte Fatlzer (ΙΙ-απ] him,
John vi. 44. But he draws by special, secret, and effica-
c' bs ce, which is conimunicated to those alone, but is

a {⁴ss others. Whence that observation of Augus-

Tlnus far concerning the primary cause of our salvation,
viz. the mercy of God predestinating and effectually calling
us3 for which cause thanks are to be given to him.

W'lzo ham made us meet] Now let us weigh the primary
effect of this divine goodness and mercy. And that is a
certain spiritual wortlnness or fitness, whereby we are, and

which are communicated to men in Christ. But that this
fitness or condition of new worthiness be found in us, pre-
supposes two things on God’s part3 powerful operation and
merciful acceptance. For it is by the Divine operation and
acceptance we are made meet to participate in the lot of
the saints.

-The divine operation is necessary, because we must be
changed and become new creatures, before we can be par-
takers of celestial benefits. For there is in us nothing but
an entire unfitness either to understand, or do, or, finally,
to receive, spiritual good. Ὀυχ ἱκανόι ἐσμεν. We are not
sufficient (ff oulselves, 2 Cor. iii. 5. ΡίεεΙι and blood cannot
inlzerit the kingdom, &cm 1 Cor. xv. 50. Except α man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God, John iii. 3.
Therefore that these obstacles may be removed, and we
may be rendered meet, God renews us by the Spirit3 he
breathes into us the new life of grace3 finally, he pours
into our minds, saith, hope, love, and those other virtues
which are required for the participation of the heavenly
promises. For this divine grace (as Aquinas has well said,
