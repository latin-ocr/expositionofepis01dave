438 AN EXPOSITION oF ετ. PAUL’s Chap. ii.

Iity of the circumcision which we have in Christ3 namely,
that it is not outward and bodily; but inward and spi-
ritual.

In pulling off the body cf tlze sins os theflesk, or in spoil-
v'ng, δια] The last thing which We proposed to be consi-
dered in the circumcision of Christ, was the remarkable
effect of this circumcision, viz. llze puttz‘ng away ofllte body
of the sins of tleestesh. See how the spiritual circumcision
which we have in Christ excels the bodily and manual cir-
cumcision! That external rite cut off a small portion of
the body: this interna! operation is wont to abolish the
whole body of sin, not the body itself‚ or the fiesh itself,
but tlze body of tlze sins of thefleslz, i. e. the mass of vices
and sins which spring from the flesh, that is to say, from
our inbred and original corruption, with which flesh the
soul of every one is no less surrounded than with its natu-
ral flesh.

We have here¹ then. a brief and perspicuous description
of inward, i. e. of true circumcision: It is aputting off the
old Adam wille his deeds, or the corrupt likeness derived to
us from our parents, infected with sin; or, as Origen re-
marks in Epist. ad Rom. cap. 2. lib. 2, lt is Ille cleansiug the
soal, and casting away the vices.

Neither is it to be wondered at that this spiritual circum-
cision should have a different effect from that corporea!
one, since it has a different agent, and different instru-
ments. For the Agent in this spiritual circumcisionis our
Lord God himself3 Deut. xxx. 6, fllze Lord thy God will cir-
cumcise thy hear-t, to love the Lord thy God wille all illine beart,
that thou mayest live. Behold the Agent, God3 the effect,
new motions in the heart itself, even spiritual life.. Butin
corporeal circumcision the agents were men: Abraham cir-
cumcised Isaac the eighth day, Gen. xxi. 43 so Joshua
circumcised the children of Israel, Josh. v. 3 But will
you expect srom men any thing beyond man? Yet further,
the instruments also are far different: for men perform cor-
poreal circumcision with corporeal instruments3 according
to what is said Josh. v, 2, Malce thee slzarp lcnz'ves, and cir-
cumcise tlte children of Israel.- But God circumcises the beart
