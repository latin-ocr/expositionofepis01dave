Ver. 12. EP1s'rL13 To THE conossrANs. 445

hath raised us up together with himself, as though he had
taken us by his hand. When, therefore, you meditate on
the death and resurrection of Christ, contemplate not only
what was done in him, but likewise what is done in thyself.
For as the Apostle divinely speakS, Ephes. ii. 5, 6, When
we were (lead in sins, he quickened us together with Christ, and
bath raised us up together and made us sz't together in heavenly
places in him.

2. It is incumbent upon every Christian, not only to
believe the death and resurrection of Christ, but to have
and perceive them in himself, that he may exhibit also to
others a real and lively testimony of the same; and this he
does who renounces sin and lives to God. Nearly to this
effect Origen wrote, In Genes. xvii. hom. 3, What does it
profit if I believe that Christ came in thatflesh osuly which he
received from Mary, and (lo not shew that he also came in this
myflesh? We may add3 What does it profit if Ι believe

and newness of life. For whoever does this, does it not in
his own strength3 but he is buried with Christ, he is risen
again in Cllrist3 and, therefore, he is planted in Christ,
and quickened by the Spirit of Christ. Thus much may
suffice respecting the cause, or fountain of our mortifica·
tion and vivification. It follows that we notice the medium
or instrument by which these benefits are apprehended.

Through, the saith of the operation (ff God, who halla raised
himfrom the dead] We come now to that instrument by
the help and assistance of which the above-named benefits
of baptism are apprehended and possessed. For if this
faith be wanting, although the treasures of grace in the
sacrament are offered on God’s part, yet they are not re-
ceived on our part, but repelled by infidelity. But the
sense of the words must be considered before we inquire
into their subject matter. These words, then, through the
