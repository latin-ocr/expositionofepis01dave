Ver. 9. EP1STLE To 'rus cotossiANs. 411

Athanasius, Orat.. 3, sayS, Unless Christ he the real Son of
God, man is notfirmly united to God: For what a mere man
hath received may be lost, as was the case with Adam. T here-

fore, tszat grace (md the gg'ft might remain firm, God assumed
our-natum,- tlzat thereby all spiritual good might be delivered
to us infirm possession. Cyril, De Incarn. Verbi, cap. l,
says, The Word was made man, that in him, and in him alone,
the nature of man being crowned witlz the endowments (ff in-
nocence, might be enriched with the Holy Spiret, vot to depart
now, as was the case with Adam, but to remain therein.

2. God chose to dwell in our nature, that thereby we
might be sure that all his merits pertained to us as brethren
and co-heirs. So says Athanasius3 The Son (ff God took
our nature upon him, tlzat henceforth we, being constituted of
earth only, should not come to the earth ; buc being joined to
heaven by the Word, should be conducted to heaven by him.
Fulgentius observes, God hath saved that in us which hc
assumed for us ; and made that nature a par-calcet* cffsalvation,
which he joined to his own ; ad Thrasimund, lib. 13)ἐ

efforts let the Reader decide from Dr. Burton's Bampton Lectures, lect. 7,
and from his ‘⁶ Testimonies of the Ante 'Nicene Fathers.” Horseiey's
Tracts against Priestley may also be well referred to ς and Townsend's New
Testament Harmony, in his Notes on the commencement of St. John's
Gospel.

⁸ Fulgentius was an ecclesiastical writer of some eminence in the early
part of the sixth century, and equally deserving of notice for his distin-
guished humility and piety. Du Pin gives an interesting account of his
parentage, the remarkable events-of his early years, the distinctions he
gained, and his singular self-denial and devotedness to a religious life3 his
being made Bishop of Ruspa, and brought under the notice of Thrasimond,
King ot the Vandals, at whose instigation he wrote a Treatise in three
books against the Arian heresy, from which the above quotation is probably
derived. Througb the influence of the Arians, Fulgentius, with all the
other Catholic Bishops of Africa, was banished into Sardinia3 and in that
retirement he wrote several other suecos, the orthodox sentiments main-
tained in which, as well as in the afore-mentioned, as reported by Du Pin,
are deserving the consideration of all who regard such sentiments when held
and enforced in the present day to be novelties. On Thrasimond's death,
Fulgentius and his companions in exile were recalled by his successor, on
which he returned to his Bishopric, and spent his remaining years in the

duties thereof as an exemplar of all that was excellent, dying in the year
533.
