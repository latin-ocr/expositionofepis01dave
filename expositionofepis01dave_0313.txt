Ver. 18. EPISTLE To THE 001„oss1ANs. 227

leat in all things lze might lzave the pre-emz‘ne72ce.] The
Apostle is now engaged in shewing that the titles above-
mentioned belong to Christ by the best possible claim.

Some refer these words to every thing which had prece—
ded therii in his description of Christ the Redeemer: as
though the Apostle had said, He is the image qs God, the
first-born <gf every creature, tlte head qf the Clncrclz, tlte be-
gz'nm'ng anclfirst-bornfrom the (lead, to this end, that in all
things he might have tlte pre-eminente, i. e. that it might be
proclaimed to the whole world, that he is the Lord of all
creatures, and placed above all things which are either in
heaven or in earth.

Others refer them to this last clause, in which Christ is
declared to be tlte-first-bornfi‘om tlze dead, in this sense;
Not only is Christ the Creator and chief of all things .
which live, but also, by his death and resurrection, he is
tlzefirst-born, he that again quickens tlte dead.- this only
was wanting to him 3 therefore, that in all things he might
have the pre-eininence, he chose to die, he chose to rise
again the first-born from tlte dead. If any other had over·-
come death, and quickened uS, then Christ would not have
had the pre-eminence in all things3 for that other would
have been the chief in respect of the dead.

Here it is proper to remark the wonderful wisdom of the
Apostle in divine things, who, in the death of Christ,
which appeared full of infirmity and ignominy, finds an ar-
gument for augmenting his glory and majesly. For al-
though this circumstanceos dying, if considered in itself,
is a mark of infirmity3 yet for any one so to die, as to raise
himself again, as to deliver all others from death, by the
power of his death and resurrection, i. e. to be the beginning
and thefirst-bornfrom tlze dead, is pre-eminently honourable
and glorious.
