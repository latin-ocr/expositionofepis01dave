Gerson, par. l, lee congregation of the Church z's united to
Christ the head, by the hond of the Holy Spirit .· beingjoz'ned
tobim by certain qualffying dispositions which give a lively
harmony to this mystical body.

But enough of testimonies. We conclude, therefore,
that this body of the Church, of which Christ himself is
the head, does not consist of any unfaithful and wicked
members, but of the pious and holy alone 3 whom God de-
livers from the power of darkness, aud translates into the
kingdom of his dear Son. Hence we may learn,

1. It is not sufficient for salvation to be a visible mem-
ber of any visible church by an outward profession of faith‚
unless you are a mystical member of the Catholic Church
by a true saith and the spirit dwelling in the heart. What
does α treacherous soul in the house offaitlz? says Cyprian.

2. Itis not befitting Christians to envy those who are
endowed with the more excellent gifts3 because they are
members of the same body: what, therefore, is conferred
on one, that should be esteemed as given to all, according
to that remark of Augustine in Psalm cxxxix. Lay aside
envy, and what I have is thine; lay aside envy, and what thou
hast is mine.

3. Since godly members are of the same body, it be·-
hoves them to be ready to assist each other3 and they
ought to feel equally affected with the good or evil which
fall to others, as with their own. So says the Apostle, l
Cor. xii. 26, If one member suffer, all tlze members snffer with
it ‚· or if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with
it. Thus far concerning the first title of Christ.

T lte beginning and the first-born from the dead] These
words are variously read aud expounded. In the Greek
they stand thus, ἀρχη ’πρωτότοκος ἐκ τω’”’ν νεκρῶν. Some, there-

Doctor, and Fuller stiles him “ the first of all Sclioolmen,'’ placing him at
the head of eight other distinguished British School Divines‚ and stating
that he was master to Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura. He wrote a
‘ Commentary on the four books of Sentences‚' or ‘ Sum of Divinity‚' at
the command of Pope Innocent IV.; Nuremberg, 1482, and often reprint-
ed. Other works have been attributed to him, but incorrectly. This
would seem to be the one from which Davenant has quoted.
