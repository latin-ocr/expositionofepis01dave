spired by God: For the devil himself knows the Scrip-
tures‚ and acknowledges them to have proceeded from the
Author of truth. Therefore in this general object of faith,
viz. the word of God, there is one special and main object
which is principally to be considered by a believer, and to
which all other things that are delivered in the Scriptures
have a certain relation and reference, as Durandus speaks,
in Prolog. Sent. And this object is, Christ Jesus in the
character of a Mediator and Saviour, which is intimated
under his very names ; for Christ Jesus means nothing else
than—artointed Saviour.

Now it is clear from the Scriptures that he is the princi-
pal object of faith, and that all other things which are de-
livered in the Scriptures regard Christ as their end and
aim. John v. 39, Search the Scriptura, they testify of me;
and a little after, Moses wrote of me. So in Luke, ult. ver.
44, All things must befuffilled which are written in the law qs
Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.
So it is affirmed concerning the whole law, that it was α
Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. Him the prophets de-
scribed3 Him the ceremonies of the law shadowed forth3
Him, in short, with all his benefits, the Gospel offers and
exhibits to us. The Apostle, therefore, has rightly placed,
as the special and principal object of faith, not the Word
of God in general, but Christ Jesus our Saviour and Media-
tor, who is principally regarded by a believer, and to whom
all things in Scripture have reference.

Now from hence it follows, that the proper and principal
act ofjustifying saith, is the apprehension and particular
application of the gratuitous promises which are offered to
believers in this Mediator, Christ. Which particular and
justifying saith includes general faith ς for if it should wa-
ver in general concerning the truth of the divine word, it
could not confide in particular concerning the promises
made to us in Christ the Mediator; but itjustffies, not so
far as it assents in general to the divine word, but so far as
it is applied to this its principal and peculiar object, viz.
to the promises of grace in the Mediator.

Which is evident, first, because as Thomas expresses it,
