For Note p. 93.

The perseeution there alluded to arose fron] the great aversion of the
Britons‚ the Scots, and the Picts to the Anti-christian rites which Austin
wished to introduce among them. They were so shocked at the many
Pagan superstitious and ceremonies introduced by him into the Saxon wor-
ship, that they looked upon it as no better than Paganism, and avoided the
communion of those who came from Rome to establish it, as they avoided
the Pagansg nay, so great was the aversion⁷ which the Scots in particular
bore to all the Roman Missionaries‚ that Dagamus, a Bishop of that nation,
not only declined sitting with them at the same table, but would not even
lodge with them under the sanie roof. Popery soon resented this in its well
known manner.-Bede‚ Eccl. Hist. 1. 2. c. 4.
