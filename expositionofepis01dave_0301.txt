tlze people. For in that lze himself bath suffered being tempted‚
lze is able to succour tlzem that are tempted.

2. Whereas our head was a man we have this comfort,
that every ground of triumphing over us is taken from the
devil. ⁴He overcame the first Adam, the head and begin-
ning of the human race; but the second Adam, the head
of the Church, overcame him. Nay‚ in Christ, we who
are his members conquer, just as in Adam we were con-
quered. The victory of our head makes us conquerors.

Thus far concerning the first question, viz. In which na-
ture Christ is the head of the CnuncH.

Now, secondly, it is proper to consider in what respects
Christ is called the ΗΕΑ D. But since this mystical head is
so called by a metaphor borrowed from the natural head,
the appellation will be obscure, unless we understand in·
what respects this similitude between Christ and the natu-
ral head, between the Church and the natural body, con-
sists. Well said the philosopher, Topic vi. cap. 2, A me-
taphor‚ by similitude, manifests to us the thing treated in for
all wlco use metapliors draw them on the ground qf some resem-
blance they bear to tlze point to be illustrated. Let us then
,take into consideration the similitude in the text.

A natural head is regarded in a twofold relation to its
members. that is to say, of difference and of agreement3
so also this mystical head: Aquinas, quaest. disp. de gratia
Christi, art. 4.

The head differs and is distinguished from its members in
three ways ε

l. In way of eminence or dignity. For the head pos-
sesses more fully and perfectly all the senses than the su-
bordinate members: so Christ, the mystical head, possesses
all spiritual grace much more abundantly than all other
men and angels put together: T lie Spirit was given to him
without measure, John iii. 321.

2. In way of direction or government. For the head
regulates and directs: the members are ruled and directed
by the head in their operations ε so Christ has the absolute
dominion and government over the Church: It obeys his
nod, and subniits in unreserved conformity to his will„
