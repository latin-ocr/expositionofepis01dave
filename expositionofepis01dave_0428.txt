342 AN EXPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL’s Chap.'1i.

Apostle, l Thess. v. 12, Know them which lahom- among you,
and are over yon iu the Lord, and admouislz you, and esteem
them very highly z'n love for their work’s sak-e.

3. They are reproved to whom it is a pleasure to con-
tend against, and strive about matters of no moment with
their Ministers, who, on their account, undergo so many
laborious conflicts: for what is more unworthy than that
he should be harassed and wounded by his fiock, who

preached the Gospeh but your voice we never heard3 nor

of prayer, of solicitude, and of writing also for thern, al*-
though he had not exercised the office of preaching among
them. Yea, he entered the lists for them in this his Epis-
tle, toeucounter their seducers.

But why does he unite the Laodiceans also? Because
this Epistle (according to his direction Chap. iv. 16) was
