Ver. 7. EPlsTLE TO Tun conossrANs. 3853

(viz. in Christ) and resting upon a due foundation ε but here
he touches on that stability which we are said to have from
the strengthening of saith itself, after that it shall have
been rooted in this soil, and built upon this foundation.
This difference it is easy to observe in trees, which as soon
as they are planted have their stability hence only, that
they are planted in firm soil : but when they shall have in-
creased in height, they have also other strength in them-
selves ε So a tender saith hath its stability in Christ; but
being increased and advanced, it acquires new strength as
to the internal habit itself. The Apostle‚ therefore, wishes
the faith of the Colossians, not only to be built upon a firm
foundation, but also to be strengthened and grow in itself
daily. ι

And whereas he joins by a parenthesis (asyle have been
taught), it tends to the greater cantion, so to speak. For
he had advised them concerning the same matter before in
the foregoing verse ; saying‚ Asye have received him, so walle
με in him.- here he again requires stedfastness of faith, and
shews in what saith they must continue3 viz. in the very
faith which they had been taught by Epaphras, not in the
novel faith of false apostles.

He twice inculcates the sanie counsel, that he may cor—
rect a wrong inclination prevailing very much among the
common people : For they were wont to grow weary of the
received doctrine, and eagerly to desire new teachers, who
led them away from the truth to their own dreanls. He,
therefore, reproves their itching ears, when he bids them
remain in the saith as they had heretofore been taught, and
forbids them to yield to the new faith of the seducers.

We have explained what stability the Apostle requires
in the doctrine of the Gospel. Now from what we have
said we may draw these instructive lessons3

1. It is not enough to be planted in Christ, unless we
are so established in him, and cleave so entirely to him,
that we neither rest on any other, as the foundation of our
faith, nor suffer ourselves to be detached from this by any
devices. F0r otherfozmdation can no man lays tlzan that is>
