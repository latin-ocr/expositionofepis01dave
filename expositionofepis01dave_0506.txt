follows that there are two persons in Christ3 and so we fall
again into the Nestorian heresy.

Ianswer; For personality more is required than to be
constituted an individual or single being: for a person
supposes not only a singular and rational substance, but,
moreover, one existing by itself, and notjoined to another
more worthy. We, therefore, admit that the human nature
of Christ, or Christ as far as he is man, is an individual or
singular3 but we deny that he is a person. And the reason
is obvious; because in the moment in which the soul of
Christ was created, and his flesh conceived, in that same
moment they were united to the Divinity. If they had
existed apart from the Logos, they would have had their
own personality: but because they began to exist together,
and to be united to the Word at the same time, there was

a necessity that this human nature should draw its perso-
nality from the Word. For any thing is called a person
from what it hath of the greatest excellence: Since, there-
fore, the Divinity is incomparably more excellent than the
humanity, the human nature deservedly takes its person-
ality from thence*

⁸* It may be permitted the Translator to observe here, that Pope Gela-
sius, the fiftieth Bishop of Rome, in defending the true doctrine of the
Union of the two natures in one person, against the Eutychians, employed
an argument which, whilst establishing the truth here contended for, at
once overturns the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and proves that it was
unknown to the Church up to his time—the close of the fifth century.
The Eutychians were supposed to believe the human nature in Christ to
have been, by its union ¹with the Divinity, absorbed by, and transformed
into the Divinity3 so that Christ could not be said to have two Natures
after the union. Against these, Gelasius undertakes to prove the realz'ty
of the two natures in Christ, notwithstanding the union3 and he argues
thus :—“ The Sacramenta· qf the Βοός] ond Blood of Christ, which we receive,
