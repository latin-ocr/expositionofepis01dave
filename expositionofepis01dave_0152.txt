66 AN EXPoslTloN or sT. PAUL’S Clzap. i.

And Prosper3 Love is α rectffied will turned from all earthly
things, and inseparably united to God, kindled by a certain
fire of the Holy Spain De vita contemp. iii. 13. He says
that love is inspired by the Holy Spirit, not the Holy Spirit
himself. To the passage cited from John, God is love, the
answer is easy3 For God is called love causally, not for-
mally (as the Schoolmen say), i. e. inasmuch as he causes
love in us 3 for he is the eternal fountain whence our love,
and all other virtues, flow to us. Or God may be called
love essentially, in the same manner as God is said to be
wisdom, and justice3 because these attributes are not ac-
cidents in God, but one and the same essence with God.
But this does not in the least prevent the possibility of our
love being a created gift3 as our prudence, and righteous-
ness, and holiness are created gifts, although God may be
rightly called prudence itself, and righteousness itself, and
holiness itself,

We see what love is. Now, in the second place, since
it is connected by the Apostle with faith, let us enquire
concerning the connexion of faith and love, viz. Whether
true saith can exist without love?

First, we grant that the mind of man can be so enlight-
ened as to believe God, i. e. to assent to the divine word
in general, and yet at the same time, be destitute of love.
The Schoolmen call thisficles informis ,ἅ we, historicalfaith‚
or generalfaith. So the very ancient Schoohnan of Altis-
siodorum, lib. 3, We believe God by itgformalfceith, i. e. that
God is, and that God is Almighty, and many other things.
Concerning this also James speaks, Chr. ii. 14, What dotlz

it profit though any one say he hathfaidc, but bath not worlcs?
Then a little after, The devils believe and tremble.

But there is also another saith, which we calljustvfying
saith, the Schoolmen fides formata,† which not only believes
God, but in God, i. e. which apprehends God as appeased
and reconciled in Ch1·ist; and this we say is never separat-
ed from love. The former is a simple irradiation, not a

³¹ That is, indefinite or crude faith.
÷ That is, formed or definite saith.
