conciled to the Father, rather than to the Son or the Holy
Spirit. First, Because the Father is the fountain of the
whole Godhead, and of all the Divine counsels and opera-
tions: on which account also it happens, that he is, in or-
der, the first of those against whom our sin is committed3
and, in order, the first of those to whom we are reconciled.

Scripture therefore usually states, that we are reconciled to
the Father, rather than to the Son, or the Holy Spirit, that
it may indicate the fountain whence reconciliation flows,
and against whom sin is first committed. The other rea-
sonis, Because the Scriptures would point out the pecu-
liar office of each Person. For although the acts of the
Trinity are ad extra indivisible‚ yet certain of them are
appropriated to each Person peculiarly. Itis, therefore,
the property of the Father, as the fountain from whence
grace flovvs, to receive us into favour: and hence the Scrip-

he took refuge at Geneva, where he remained two years3 and then, declin-
ing an invitation to England to fill a Divinity professorship at Oxford, he
proceeded to Strasburg. Here he obtained the Theological professorship,
and read lectures both in Divinity and in the Aristotelian philosophy, with
great reputation, till 1563, when, owing to the increased annoyance and
persecution he had to endure at Strasburg, he removed to Chiavenna, in the
Grisons, in the capacity of Pastor to a reformed congregation there. Dur-
ing his residence here, he had to witness the devastation of a dreadful pes-
tilence among his flock, which almost depopulated the place. The Divinity
Chair at Heidelberg becoming vacant in 1568, he was induced to accept of
it, and settled there under the immediate patronage of Frederic III. Elector
Palatine, at whose instigation he composed two celebrated treatises, th‘e one
entitled De Dei ηαίιινᾶ ,· the other, the one quoted above, De tribus Elolzz'm
uno eodemque ιῙεῘιιηίι. The treatises were directed principally against the So-
cinian heresy, the advocates for which were exhausting every artifice to de-
grade the Son, and Spirit of God, to the level of mere creatures. His ami-
able and enlightened Patron had urged Zanchius to be very particular in
canvassing the arguments made use of by the Socinians3 and Zanchius gave
himself to the work in a truly Christian spirit3 producing two treatises
fraught with the most solid learning and argument3 and breathing, at the
same time, germine candour and sterling piety. The death of the Elector
in 1578 occasioned his resignation of the Professorship at Heidelberg: but
although he took up his abode after this event at Newstadt, he returned to
Heidelberg in 1585, ancl there passed the remainder of his days, dying in
that place in mou—He was the author of several other important contro-
versial treatises, of which one ‘³ On the Doctrine of Predestination,'’ has
been translated into English—Vide Middleton and Gorton.
