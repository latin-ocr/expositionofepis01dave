the rules of good and sound logie, the truth of this doc-
trine. This use of reason and logio in sacred things, God
is so far from condemning, that he requires it of all ε nay,
for this‘ end he plants in human minds certain laws ofjudg-
ing, and of discerning· truth from falsehood, certainty from
uncertainty, consequenti-al from inconsequential reasoning,
that we may use this light of reason in all things, and es-
pecially in Divine matters. Ephes. v. 17, Be not uuskilful,

for the instruction of those who have not yet enrolled them-
selves under Christ, as for resistance, if they should obsti-
nately oppose our Religion. He who has been born and
constantly educated in darkness, is not directly to be drawn
into the clear light of the sun, lest it should lxappen that
by so much light he should* be overpowered rather than en-
lightened: so they who have been educated from childhood
in the darkness of paganism‚ cannot immediately bear the
light of the Gospel‚ bnt are first to be awakened by rea-
sons drawn from natural light, to contemplate this light.
So Paul acted with the Athenians, Acts xvii. 24. Cle-
mens Alexandrinus, strom. l, illustrates the reason of this
