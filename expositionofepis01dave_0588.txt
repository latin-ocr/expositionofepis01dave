Augustine, and more cheerfully to my Jesus, than to any qf
the holy spirits of God, De vis. infirm. lib. 2. cap. 2. That
humility, then, which leads us from Christ the Mediator is
to be renounced: If any man sin, we have an advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the propitia-
tionfor our sins, &c. 1 John ii. 1, 2.

And worshipping of angels] That improper lowliness of
mind begets superstitious worship. The Latin word colo,
commonly used for worship, is of a general significati0n3
and we are rightly said colere— to revere, not only God, but
parents, or any other superiors. Thus speaks Cicero :
Dat-vs is that by which we reoerence, and colimus, worship supe-

worship: For it is derived (as Plutarch writes) from the
Thracians, among whom Orpheus first taright the worship

between us and the Papists a great controversy about the
worship of angels, and deceased saints, who are ισαγγελοι,

seen with whom the truth lies, we shall briefly dispatch
these three points. First, we shall shew a distinction of
worship: Secondly, demonstrate that religious worship is
due to God alone ; Thirdly, prove that this worship render—
ed formerly by these seducers to angels and saints, and now
by the Papists, is forbidden.

1. As to the first; Worship is obedience rendered to any
one on account (ff his excellence. But under the word obedi-
ence I include the act of the mind, whereby we apprehend
the excellence of the person, or of the thing honoured3
the act of the will, whereby we submit inwardly to him,
and are ready to acknowledge it by suitable offices; and
the act of the body, whereby we shew the outward sign of
our humility. But now this worship is exercised with
a threefold difference, according to a threefold excel-
