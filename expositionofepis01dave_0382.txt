range tln's economy who endeavour to introduce equality of
ministers into the Church. For order, according to the cor-
rect definition of the Schoolmen, is tlze distribution of simi-
lar and dissimilar tlzings, assigning to each its proper place;
and wherever there is a plurality without order, confusion
immediately arises. Now, according to this arrangement
and economy of God, one is appointed a bishop, others are
ordained priests, others deacons3 nor ought those who are
placed in inferior situations to assume those functions
which belong to their superiors. For the Lord himself of the
family gave some Apostles ,· cmd some Evangelists ; ond others
Pastors and teaclzers, Ephes. iv. ll ; and in place of those,
it was his will that ministers should be substituted for ever,
distinct in their proper orders.

4. Since God has shewn such care in regulating the
administration of the Church‚ it is the duty of each indi-

xxiv. 45, Who Ilien is tlzcttsaitlffnl and wise servant, whom lzz's
Lord ΙιαῐΙι made ναῖεν over his lzousehold, &a This dispen-
sation of God committed to his ministers, requires both
faithfulness to will, and wisdom and knowledge to perform,
the duties assigned to them in this eeonomy of God.

And thus far concerning this miuistry, and the Author
and Ordainer of it, viz. God himself.

Which is given to mesoryon] Now, in the third place,
we must explain to whom this miuistry, or dispensation,
which was delegated to Paulby God himself, had relation.
It is given to me, he says, jor, or on account of you ; i. e. you
Gentiles; amongst whom the Colossians are included. The
Apostle seems desirous of shewing, that he taught them in
his own right, as a part of the Gentile Church, which was
particularly entrusted to him. Thai this ministry of in-
structing tlte Gentiles was indeed entrusted to Paul, is evi-
dent from many passages of Scripture: As Acts xxii. 21,
