-the afflicted Primate: but despising the groundless objectioni os
those who, from motives of personal pique and ambidon, were
willing to give up their own high views of the indelibility of the
Episcopal character, and act upon the principle that it became
vitiated and abortive in its operations, by an accident which, as
the Kiug justly remarked, might have happened to an angel. The
rest, however, made so much of their scruples‚ that a commis-
sion was at length granted to the Bishop of London and four
others, to discharge the Archiepiscopal sunction in this case; and
by these, Williams was consecrated on Nov. 11 : and Davenant,
Laud, and Cary of Exeter, on Nov. 18.

Having resigned his Margaret Professorship‚ in which he was
succeeded by his friend Dr. VVard, he took his leave of College;
and in bidding farewell to his old servant there, one John Rolfe,

and framed his measures upon what he deemed the most wise and
successful example in these times of peculial· difficulty and dan-

scientioris.

'I‘hough benevolent and cheerful, Davenant never lost sight of
the consistent dignity and gravity of 1115 character. Upon one
occasion, as Fuller records, being invited to dine with Field,
Bishop of Hereford‚ and not well pleased with the loose company
he met there, he embraced the earliest opportunity of departing;
and when Field would have lighted him down stairs, “ My lord,
my lord‚'' said he, “ let us enlighten others by our unblamable
conversation.’⁷ At the same time he is spoken of as remarkably
