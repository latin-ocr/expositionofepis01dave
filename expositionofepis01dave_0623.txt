have the least doubt about those things which are set forth
by the Romish Church, as to faith or practice in Religion
and the worship of God. But we, notwithstanding, may
truly assert, that this blind obedience and humility is not
only foolish, but impious and irreligious. And the grounds
for this are,

1. Because we are bound to obey superiors only in cases
in which they are our superiors. Now, as to the framing
doctrines of saith, or instituting the worship of God, God

alone is our Superior: if, therefore, men attempt to devise
doctrines of faith, or to introduce a new worship, they
step beyond the limits of the power granted them, and are

Sharon Turner's Modern History of England. As evincing itself more
recently, let him consider the late Records of Ireland, and the investiga-
tions in our houses of Parliament; let him bear in mind the late Revolu-
tion in France (vide Note, p. 76): above all, let him reflect on the well-
known boast of Cardinal Gonsalvi, that they (the Papists) had such influ-
ence with the Turkish Court, as to suppl-ess the further spread of Heresy
there : This was manifested by the Papacy succeeding in procuring a Firman
against the proceedings of the agents of the British and Foreign Bible So-
ciety, and the progress of the Protestant Missionaries in Turkey ! !
