that ordination is so peculiar to Bishops, that it is not lawful for
Presbyters to exercise it. What does α Biskop do, ordination ex-
cepted, which a Presbyter does not? In this Apostolic Institu-
tion the Catholic Church always acquiesced, and did not acknow-
ledge any other ordination lawful than that which was solemnized
by a lawful Bishop. We find a remarkable example of this in the
works of Athanasius. One Colythus‚ a Presbyter in the Church
of Alexandria, presumed to ordain other Presbyters. But what
was afterwards done ἲ lez's ordination of leis was rescinded, and
all the Presbyters made by him were reduced to the rank of lay-
men. (Athan. Apolog. 22.) It is, therefore, certain, that the power
of ordaining belongs to the office of Bishops only, and does not
belong to inferior Presbyters, which is a manifest proof of Epis-
copal dignity and Presbyterial inferiority.

Eut here, in passing, we have to solve a doubt which was not
omitted by the Schoolmen themselves ;† for it is often questioned,
Whether, besides a Bishop, who, hy his office, dispenses sacred
orders, can one inferior to aBishop confer the same in case of ne-
cessity? Το which l answer, Seeing that to confer holy orders is,
by Apostolical institution, an act of the Episcopal office, if Pres-
byters in a well constituted Church do that, their act is not only
unlawi'ul, but is null and void. For here obtains the axiom of
Hugo, What is performed contrary to the institution is accounted
null. But in a disturbed Church, where all the Bishops have
fallen into heresy or idolatry, where they refuse to ordain ortho-
dox ministers‚ or where they account those alone to be worthy of
holy orders who participate in their error and factiosi, if orthodox
Presbyters be compelled to ordain other Presbyters‚ that the
Church may not pelisii, I could not venture to prononnce ordina-
tions of this kind vain and invalid. For if the danger that threat-
ens a single infant be sufficient to transfer the office of baptiz-
ing to any layman, which, by institution, belongs to ministers
alone, why is not danger impending overa particular Church, suf-
ficient to transfer the office of ordaining to simple priests, which,
by institution, belongs to Bishops alone? Necessity has been
aptly called temporariis laum and in such case it defends that to
