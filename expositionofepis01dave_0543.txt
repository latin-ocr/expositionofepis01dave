Ver. 13. EPlsTLE To 'ri-113 cohosslANS. ι157

You see our Deliverer, God in Christ, or with Christ;
now let us consider the mode of this deliverance from the
most wretched condition of sin and death.

Having forgiven ‘you all trespasses] He now explains
what was stated in the preceding words, that God had
quickened the Colossians together with Christ, by shewing
how it was done 3 viz. by the free forgiveness of all their
sins. But we must also add 3 that with this forgiveness of
sins which quickeus the soul, there must be understood to
be always united at the same tim'e, the infusion of sancti-
fying grace, which also quickens in another sense: as is
evident from the foregoing verse. For 'when sin is remit-
ted, guilt is not only taken away, but the will, disordered
and marred through sin, is quickened and restored through
grace. Therefore the infusion of grace is always joined
with this forgiveness of sin.

In this forgiveness of sins two things are to be notieed:
that it is gratuitous, and that it is universal.

That it is gratuitous the word χαρισαμενος shews, being de-
rived from the word gracia—grace itself. But we are to
understand that it is gratuz'lous on our part: for we are ab·
solved without any price paid by ourselves 3 but on the part
of Christ we are redeemed with a price, namely his most
precious blood. This the Schoolinen themselves acknow-
ledge3 Remission of sin, says Durandus, lib. 4. dist. 1.
quaest. 7, is nothing else than tlte not imputz'ng it as to punish-
ment. This the Apostle teaches, Rom. iii. 24, when he af-
firms that we are justified freely by the grace qf God, tlzrouglz
the redemption that is in Clzre'st Jesus : then Chap. iv. verses
7 and 8, he shews that this grace consists in this, that
God is willing to remit, and unwilling to impute, sin to
us. And, indeed, if we *seriously examine the matter
itself, either a gratuitous remission, or no remission at all,
must be admitted. As to ourselves, we are not able to
pay3 since the debt is infinite, and we, and all that belongs
to us, finite. We cannot make any satisfaction by doing;
because our good deeds are gifts of God, are due to God,
are few and imperfect: nor can we blot out our sins by suf-
fering, because no punishment of guilty man is deletive of
