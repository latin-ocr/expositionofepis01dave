Ver. 4. EPISTLE To THE conossxANS· 65

nothing else than the Holy spirit himself immediately mov-
ing the will to the act of love. For he put this difference
between love and the other virtues, that the Holy Spirit
moved.the soul to acts of other virtues, by the interme-
diate infusion of certain habits, but to the act of love im-
mediately by himself, without any other habit being cre-
ated or infused. And he grounded this opinion especially
upon that passage of John, l Epis. iv. 8, God is love,- and
again in vers. 16, God is love, aud he that dwelletlz in love,
dwelletlz in God, and God in him. But this opinion can by
no means be supported: for as saith and hope are created
gifts, so also love is a habit created by God, by which the
will is inclined to love God above all things for his own
sake, and all other persons for the sake of God. Foris the⁴
act of love were an immediate motion of the will by God,
without a habit infused, it would follow, First, that the
act of love would not be voluntary, because it proceeds
neither from the will naturally (for love is above nature),
nor from the will as perfected by supernatural habit3 but
only from the will as it is moved as the instrument of a
superior cause 3 just as the hand Orthe foot may be moved
by something else. Secondly, it would follow, that man
would not have any promptitude in love, or delight in the
exercise of love: for promptitude and delight in actions,
argue a habit either acquired or infused-

The Scripture itself also opposes this comment of Lom-
bard, and clearly teaches that ἀ’γάπη, or our love, is not
the Holy Spirit, but α fruit of tlte Holy Spiris, Gal. v. 22.
The Fathers also testify against it. Ἀγαπη ἐστ-ί διάθεσις
Ψυχης· ’ayasm it is α disposition (gfllle mind by wlzz'clz it is made
to prefer nothing to God, Maxim 1. centur. sentent. tom. 7.

was first appointed Canon of Chartoes, afterwards Tutor to Philip, son of
Lewis VI„ and finally Bishop of Paris. He died in 1064. His great work
of the Sentences is looked on as the source of the Scholastic Theology of
the Latin Church, as that of Damascenus had been of the Greek. Of the
occasion and nature of this work, of so much importance in the conduct of
Papal Theology, Du Pin has given a full and interesting account in his Ec-
clesiastical History, Cent. 12. Chap. xv. Lombard also wrote Commen-
taries on the Psalms, and on St. Paul's Epistles.
