For, first, that which was instituted in the Jewish Church by the
most wise God‚ that a High Priest should be set over the other priests,
and the priests over the Levites, (Numb. iii. and iv.) was prelusive to
the establishing a like order in the Christian Church. Hence the
remark of Jerome, That we may know that the Apostolical traditions
were takenfrom the Old Testament‚ what Aaron and his sons and
the Levites were in the temple, the Bishops, Presbyter-s, and Dea-
eons elaimfor themselves z'n the Church. It was the will os God
that a certain order should flourish among the ministers of the Old
Testament: the Church willed that an order not dissimilar should
be found among hers. But where all are equal in dignity and power,
there not even a shadow of becoming order is retained. For or-
der is nothing else than the disposal of equais and unequals,
assigning to each its place. Take away the inequality, and by
the same act you leave among sacred ministers all order thrown
into confusion.

SecomIly, lt is evident, that Christ himself, for the edification
ol' his Church, constituted ministers not endued with equal autho-
rity, but distinct in degree of dignity and power. For the twelve
Apostles were superior to the seventy disciples, and were placed
above the same, not in excellency of gifts alone, but in amplitude
of authority and power. Moreooer, it is the constant doctrine of
nearly all the Fathers, that the Bishops succeeded the Apostles in
the ordinary government of the Church, as the Presbyters also
succeeded the seventy disciples. Let one of thern, Augustine‚
speak for all, upon those words of the Psalnnst, INSTEAD or
THY FATHERS THOU SHALT 11Avss cummium, (Psalm xliv. ;)
What is this, says he, INSTEAD OF Tfiv FATHERS ΤΗου snALr
HAVE cfflLDnEN ’ξ The Apostles were sent as fathers. Instead
of the Apostles, sons were born to thee; Bishops were constituted.
For those who are at this day Bishops throuyh all the world,
whose children were they ? The Chureh herself calls them
Fathers‚· but she herself yave them birth, ancl she herself consti-
tuted them z'n the seats of thefathers. The same is the sentiment
of Jerome, Ambrose, and Theodoret3 all of whom agree in ac-
knowledging Bishops to be the successors of the Apostles, not in
their extraordinary privileges, which were necessary to lay the
foundation of the Church, but in that ordinary superiority which
is required for her perpetual conservation and extension when
founded. Add to this, that, immediately after the ascension of
Christ, the Chureh was adorned ancl distinguished by evangelical
