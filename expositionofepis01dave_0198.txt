112 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL'S Clzap. i.

We cease nol to pray and desirefor you] The Apostle
now expresses the manner of his praying, which is per-
ceived in two things: in its importunity‚ we cease not,· in
its fervid devotion, to pray (md desire.

freedom of speaking against reigning vices, and especially in declaiming
against the gaiety, impiety, and corruption that prevailed at the Court of
Arcadius, raised him many powerful enemies. Theophilus of Alexandria
first obtained his deposition and banishinent 3 but so great was the tumult
of the people, that the Emperor was compelled to send him letters of recal.
Eudoxia, however, soon after had him banished again to a most inhospitable
and barbarous place in Armenia. But there he gained such respect that the
jealousy of his enemies was further excited, and an order was procured for
his removal to a still worse station, the very shore of the Black Sea3 when,
as he was being removed, the soldiers (no doubt suitably instructed) treated
him so roughly that he died by the way, A. D. 407, in the 60tl1 year of his
age. Chrysostom, if not so Evangelical in his views as some of the Fathers,
yet confined himself more to the litei-al and historic-al sense of the divine
word than others; and is justly ranked among the most eminent Christian
orators: his eloquence was manly, and his fidelity as a minister of God's
word unbending; his genius was uncommon‚ and his erudition extensive.
He exhibited himself both as a moral and controversial writer; composed a
great number of homilies; and his works were so abundant as to form thir-
teen folio volumes. His treatise on the Priesthood has been translated into
English: and we are further indebted‚ if not to his own pen, yet to a
Greek Liturgy commonly ascribed to him as the cornpiler, for that most
excellent prayer at the close of our daily service, than which it would be
difficult to conceive one more suitable to the conclusion of our prayers and
supplications.

The Translator is informed, that in the service of the Greek Church as
performed in Russia, no less than five prayers of St. Chrysostom are re-
tained, of which the following is one; and, as a testimony of that Church's
holding the essentials to salvation‚ and as corresponding with the statements
already given in this work of the doctrine of the sacred Trinity, the inser-
tion of it in this place may not be deemed impertinent ε

“ It isjust and right to praise Thee, to magnify Thee, to worship Thee,
in all places of thy dominion 3 for thou art, O God, unspeakable, unknown,
unseen, incomprehensible3 Thou art the very same from eternity; Thou
and thine only Son, and thine Holy Ghost. Thou broughtest us out of
nought into existence, and when we were fallen through our disobedience‚
thou liftedst us up again, in that thou didst every thing to bring us to hea-
ven, and to give us an inheritance in thy kingdom which is to come. For
these and all other benefits, known and unknown, seen or hidden, we give
tlianks to Thee, and thine only Son, and thine Holy Ghost. Accept our
humble thanks that thou hast vouchsafed to receive this service at our
hands: Thou who art surrounded with thousands of archangels, and ten
