these, as much as in them lies, set aside the eternal decree
of God respecting human salvation.

2. Allfulness dwell] This is that other reason why
Christ is most properly called tlte head (ff the Clzurclm and
it is taken from the formal cause, in this manner3 God,
whom it pleased that Christ should be llze head qs llze
Clzzcrclz, not only so ordained by decree, but, besides, fur-
nished him with all the gifts which were requisiie to render
him the szcz'table head of tlte Clzurclz. This title, therefore,
most especially befits him.

Bysulness in this place some understand a fulness of
Deity3 others, a fulness of habitual grace.>2ss Itis certain
each fulness dwells in Christ3 and perhaps the Apostle de-
sired to comprehend each. For doubtless he asserts, that
there is in Christ whatever is requisite to render him the
perfect Redeemer of mankind, and tlze head of the C'hurclz .·
but sor undertaking these offices, both a fulness of Divi-
nity anda fulness of habitual grace are requisite. Con-
cerning the Deity of Christ we have before spoken : of the
fulness of habitual grace we shall only shew these three
things briefly.

l. That this fulness of grace was in Christ.

2. Adduce some reasons why it was befitting that a ful-
ness of grace should be in Christ.

3. We will shew that this fulness of grace was the pri-
vilege of Christ alone.

l. As to the first; when we say that there was in the
man Christ a fulness of habitual grace, we mean not that
this grace was infinite: for, since it is a created quality,
and is inherent in the soul of Christ, which also was crea-
ted, it cannot be infinite. But by tlzesulness eff grace we
understand all those perfectioris to which the term grace
extends itself. For whereas a certain measure of grace is
found in other nien, so that one inan may be endowed with

some gift of grace in which another is wanting3 in Christ
