mystery for the promulgation of which Paul was made α mi-
nister.

2. But where and how was this mystery concerning the
salvation of mankind by Christ lziclden? It was hidden, as
was slightly touched upon before, in the secret and eternal
purpose of God; for God himself decreed, even from all
eternity, to conceal and hide from us this mystery, even
until the fulness of the time should come. Therefore was
itlaid up and removed to a great distance from us. For
what can be further removed from human sight, than that
which is hid in the secret repository of God's will?
Hence it is termed by the Apostle, in Roni.xvi. 25, the mys-
tery kept secret Since the world began. But there was also an
interposed veil, as it were, of the legal ceremonies, under

says, in Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20, He slzezcetlz his word wito Jacob,
lzz's statutes and lzz'sjudgments wito Israel: He lzatlz not dealt
so with any mztion, and as to lzis judgments they bave not
known them. From the Gentiles, therefore, was this mys-
tery absolutely and totally'hidden.

With respect to the Jews also, who lived under the Old
Testament, this mystery was partly and comparatively hid-
den from them. Par-ily, because, with the exception of
the prophets and a few inspired men, the general mass of
the Jews, though they did expect the Messiah, expected
him only as coming to themselves ; they never thought of
