arms delivered his men, and recovered thern from the
hands of the Amalekites, 1 Sam. 30. But neither in this
manner ought the human race to have been delivered : for
although Christ might justly wrest from the devil, by main
force, the prey which that robber had acquired by wicked
craft3 yet could not rnan, guilty as he was of treason
against God‚ be reconciled in that manner.

remained, viz. that which might be effected by way ofjus-
