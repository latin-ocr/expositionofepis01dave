Ver. 19. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSMNS. 513

From which all the body byjoincs and hands having ηοω-ἰήι-
ment minister-ed, (md lenit together, increaselh with the increase
(f God.] He illustrates the effects of Christ the Head by
metaphors borrowed from the natural head and body. For
as the memberS, whilst they are joined to the Head, receive
life, motion, and sense from it, by arteries, veins, and
nerves, and are also connected with each other by certain
ligarnents : so, whilst Christians cleave to Christ the Head,
they receive and draw from him spiritual lise by spiritual
joints and hands, and, moreover, are united to each other
by the strongest ties.

All those things which bind us to Christ, and by which
celestial benefits are supplied to us, are. called commissurcr,
or ‘amba-joint& and all those things by which the members
cohere together under this Head, and communicate mutual
advantages to each other, are termedjuncturm, or σύνδεσμοι,
hands. The phrase now-islmzent mim's‘ered, must, therefore,
be connected with joinls; and kuic together, with hands.
The former has respect to the union of the members with
Christ3 the latter to the union and binding together of the
members with each other3 and from both the increase of
the Church resultS. Which two things, for the sake of
perspicuity, we shall consider apart.

First, then, the effect which is obtained from cleaving
to Christ our Head is this, that llee whole body, cleaving
indeed to him, hath byjoints nonrz'slzment ministered.

Now, truly, the joints by which we are united to Christ
the Head, and by which the influence of Christ is derived
to us, are the Spirit of Christ, and the gifts of the same
Spirit, especially saith, which is the hand whereby spiritual
benefits are apprehended. Without the Spirit of Christ,
no one isjoined to Christz. [f any man lzave not tlze Spiric
(ff Clerz'st, lie is none <ff his, Rom. viii. 9. Therefore, that
we may be quickened and united to Christ, first of all
God pours into us the Spirit of Christ. For as that mem-
ber is not truly united to the head which is not animated
with the same essence as the head itself3 so neither is that
Christian united to Christ who lacks the Spirit of Christ.
This spirit, therefore, is the primary joint by which we
