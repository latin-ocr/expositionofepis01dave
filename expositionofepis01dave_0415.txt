lib. xi. cap. 10.

2. That ministers ought to make up their minds, not
only to labour in the word, but even to labour for the word
under the cross. For the cross is the portion of all the
godly, but especially of ministers. Hence said Christ to
his Apostles, John xvi. 2, The time will come that whosoever
lcilletlz you will thinlc that he doeth God service. And in the
last verse, In the world fise shall have tribulation. A certain
one said, It is princely to have α bad characterfor doing well.-
but I should rather say, It is priestly to suffer cruelty for
doing well. Hence Paul writing to Timothy unites both,
in 2 Epis. iv. 53 Do the work of an Evangelist; there is la-
bour in execution! endure afflicti0ns; there is firmness in
suffering! He who has learnt these two lessous, the same
knows with Paul how to labour and strive; to sustain la—
bour in the word; afflictions and dangers for the word.
These cannot be separated : for he is defective in his voca-
tion who dreads to suffer for the truth. Patz'ence in the
things of God is so inculcoted, says Tertullian, in his trea-
tise‚ De patient. cap. l, because he who z's α stranger to pa-
tience can obey uo precept, can perform no work pleasz'ng to the
Lord. For this is the shield of every virtue—So much
concerning the labour: now let us consider the Helper.

According to lzis working, which worketh in me miglctily]
i. e. according to the effectual working of Christ. This is
that other argument whereby the Apostle enhances his 1ni-
nistry, and shews at the same time his modesty and humi-
lity. He had affirmed that he laboured and strove to pre-
sent every man perfect in Christ Jesus : Now he adds that
he did this not relying upon human strength or his own
powerS, but upon the divine assistance of Christ, streng-
thened and aided by his might.

Concerning this efficacy, or might of Christ, we shall con-

sider three things: the origin of it3 the mode, and the
effect.
