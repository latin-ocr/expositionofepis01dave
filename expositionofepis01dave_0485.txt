been taught or learned.

5. In the last place, I also add this3 that it may even
be employed to the moderate and useful delight of the
hearers, as a certain seasoning‚ as it were, drawn from po-
lite literature. For, if the Divine benignity shall have
granted us bodily food, not only necessary to repel hunger,
but sweet and pleasant to delight the taste3 why should
we not also account this same to be granted us in regard to
spiritual food? especially since this delight hath useful-

pearance of secret and sublime wisdorn‚ yet Paul con-
demned and exploded it as vain and deceifful. Now he cen-
sures a second sort of false-doctrine, which he calls the tra-
ditionof men. But he does not intend those curious and
abstruse speculations which he has before glanced at underv
the name of philosophy (for those doctrines had a certain
shadow of wisdotn)‚ but superstitious and foolish obser-
vances, founded in external things, which rested upon cus-
torn and antiquity alone, but were confirmed very much
either by the pretended visions of impostors, or by the
