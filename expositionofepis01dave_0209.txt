Ver. 10. EpisTLE 'ro THE COLOSSIANS. 123

The Apostle in the verse before us does two things: He
proposes, in general, the sum of this his desire, Thatyse
might toallc worchy of the Lord. Then he draws it out into
parts, and explains how we may walk worthy of God:
First, as to the intention and scope, if we refer all things
ἐις ἀρέσκειαν, to the pleasing of God ; secondly, as to the two-
fold operation, if we be fruitful in works, and increase in the
knowledge of God.

That με might walls worthgs of the Lord.] To walk is an
Hebrew phrase, often put in the Scriptures for beginning
and keeping to a course of life : as to walle deceizfully, and
with simplicit-y, in many passages of the Proverbs of Solo-
mon; and to walle in the ways and z'n the statutes of God, as
is frequent with David in the Psalms‚ So in the New Tes-
tament, to walle according to the flesk, and according to the
Spirit, i. e. to live and to converse. By this form ofspeak-
ing, we are admonished that Christianity consists in a per-
petual journey towards the celestial country, and that no
one must halt by the way, but must perpetually walk and
go forward. But how is he to walk?

Worthgs qs* the Lord.] What these words mean we shall
readily understand, if we compare them with similar forms
of speaking, which occur elsewhere in this our Apostle; so
Ephes. iv. l, I prag( that με wall„- wortlzy of the vocation.
Phil. i. 27, he exhorts them to conduct themselves worthy
of God. He walks worthy of the Lord, therefore, who so
lives as becomes him who is called by the Gospel to the
adoption of the sons of God, and to the lively hope of the
inheritance of heaven.

Here some may ask, How is it possible to walk in a
manner worthy of the Lord, or of God, or of the Gospel,
or of our vocati0n3 since nothing adequately corresponds
to the high excellency of all these things, except perfect
and immaculate righteousness and holiness, such as is not
found in men who retain this body of sin?

I answer, the word worth-ts, in the Scriptures, does not
always denote the exact proportion of equality of one

thing to another, but a certain accord-auce or suitableness,
