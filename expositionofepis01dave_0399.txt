riches of the glor-y of his inlzeritance in llze saints.

The Apostle introduces the word glor-y that he may ob-
viate the scandal which men pretend 311868 from the con-
temptibleness of the Gospel: sor in the estimation of car-
nal men, the doctrine of the Gospel seems contemptible.
That all men, therefore, may be assured that there is
nothing really contemptible in the Gospel, he employs
these splendid eulogies to exalt its dignity3 nay more, to
shew that it is altogether so glorious as deservedly to claim
every kind of honour.

This mystery of salvation, then, contained in the Gospel,
is properly called glorious for two reasons3 one of which
may be considered on God's part, the other 011 ours. Ι

011 God’s part, because nothing so properly shews forth

as might be abundantly proved were we inclined to descant
more at large on this general topic. But let us fix upon
only one of these virtues, viz. the divine compassion: of
which Cicero has well remarked, De Offio. 2, Ic most re-
dozmds to our gloris, ij ever we have opportunity, of helping
a man wlzo appears to be surromtded and borne down by a pow-
erful enemy, To which we may add, that it is more emi-
nently glorious to exert this kindness when neither called
upon so to do by the deserts of the individual relieved, nor
induced to it by any prospect of remuneration. Now let
us apply this observation to the case before us. The whole
human race lay prostrate under the tyrannous oppression
of that most powerful of all enemies, the devil; but the
mystery of the Gospel teaches us, that through the aid of
the Divine compassion, and without any previous merit of

our own, we are snatched from under the burden of their
