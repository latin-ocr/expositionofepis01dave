Ver.2-'3. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSlANs. 545

and health should fail it to undergo the duties which de-
volve upon us in our vocation. He who rejects this latter
care, holds his body in no honour3 and some think that
this kind of person is reproved in this place.

This is a probable interpretation: But neither do I think
the interpretation of Beza is to be despised; who refers
those words, not in am] honour, to the very rites and coni-
mandments of abstaining from and choosing meats, and
thinks they are answered from the contrary. Which indeed
havea shew Qf im‘sdoue, ‘yet are not of 0⁷²3! worth. Beza sup-
plies the word yet, because it is usual with those who adopt
the Hebrew idioin (as Paul occasionally does), to under-
stand the adversative particle. But now, isit be asked, ‹
Why are not those cornmandments of men of any value,
the Apostle gives the cause, for tlze settissyiteg (ff tlzeflesla,
they refer, ”ouva or συντείν οντα, lo the sati-§sying of theflesh, i. e.
they rest in meat and drink‚ and things earthly and vain,
in which the kingdom of God does not consist, but in
those which relate to spiritual sustenance and life eternal;
as was shewn in the foregoing· verse. But the Apostle as-
serts commandments of this kind to be of no value or
moment, not because they are void of all utility, if pro-
posed and observed with. knowledge and moderatiore, as
Athanasius advises; but they are in themselves of no value
and moment for justification‚ sanctification, satisfaction for
sins, and the worship of Goel, as the seducers would con-
tend they were.

It is not needFul to add more concerning this censure of
the Apostle, which relates to these ordinances referring to
external things3 for we have often treated sufficiently of
this matter. The fourth part of this Epistle yet remains ;
which contains instruction in niorals‚ roots out vices, incul-
cates virtues, and, finally, forms the life of Christians‚ as
well in respect to their common duties, as to their social
relations.
