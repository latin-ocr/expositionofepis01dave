Ver. 8. EPISTLE To THE corossmns. 393

That we may, therefore, accommodate these points to
the matter in hand ς The false Apostles, under the pretext
of a certain secret wisdom, endeavoured to obtrude upon
the Colossians certain new doctrines about the worship of
angels, the expiation of souls, and other things of that
kind, drawn, no doubt, from the writings of the Platonists.
What says Paul to these things? Believe not3 he re-
plies: fallacions and vain is philosophy when it prescribes
about religion. It behoves you to learn how God the Fa-
ther would be approached, how your sin ean be expiated,
not from Plato and human reason, but from God and his
word. Let us explode, therefore, and condemn philosophy
promulgating directions concerning these things.

But it is objected, that divine and spiritual things are
known to human reason, and that by the natural light of
the same : for thus says the Apostle, Rom. i. 19, 20, Tlmt
which may be known (ff Gocl is manifest in them ;—lee invi-
sible things of ln‘m from the creation (ff tlte world, being un-
derstood, &c⁸ If reason comprehends divine things, then
may it determine respecting them, neither will it, therefore,
be called vain.

It is answered3 The natural knowledge of spiritual
things is obscure and feeble, extending only to the exis-
tence of those things. As, for instance, that there is a
God, that there is a worship of God, that there is a bles-
sedness for souls, reason and philosophy perceives3 but
how God is to be worshipped, how happiness is to be ob-
tained, it discovers not: whilst, therefore, it attempts to
determine respecting these things and the like, it is ‘cain
and (leceigful. This knowledge may render a man inex-
cusable, but it cannot render him a competent teacher, un-
less knowledge infused by grace be added.

3. Let us approach to what we proposed to tre-at of in
the last place, viz. to shew the abuse and use of reason or
philosophy in the business of religion. For they who per-
petually cry out for the exclusion of human reason from
treating of sacred things, without discrimination, seem to
require that men should engage in the greatest affairs with-
out reason ; when, indeed, they cannot rightly manage the
least, if that natural light of reason be extinguished.
