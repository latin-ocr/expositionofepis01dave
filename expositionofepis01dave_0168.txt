82 AN ExpostTloN OF sr. PAUL⁷s Chap. i.

But because it agrees in other respects with the former
interpretation, while in this one it differs, that it makes the
hope reserved in heaven, the motive, not in respect of Paul's
giving thanks‚ but of the saith and love of the Colossians ς
we shall discuss only this one question3

Whether it is lawful to do good works, such as to be-
lieve in Christ, to love the saints, with a view to, or for
the sake of the reward reserved in heaven‘.l

Against this is objected John x. 12, where the Saviour
reprehends hirelings, who propose to themselves their own
advantage in feeding the sheep of God.

To this we answer, They are not blamed because they

I answer, God himself is the reward promised to the
faithful ς therefore whilst they expect and regard an
eternal reward, they expect nothing but God. But if we
understand the reward to be not God himself, but the very
act of enjoying God 3 then it must be answered otherwise,
viz. that this reward is not to be so regarded, that it should
be the end for which we love God, but only that it should
