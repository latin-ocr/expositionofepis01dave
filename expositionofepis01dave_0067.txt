having] elected onefrom themselves, ond placed hz'm z'n α hz'yher
degree, named him Bishop. From this eminent authority of one
Bishop in one city or diocese, the most wise and holy Fathers saw
-that the peace and unity of the Chureh depended, and they have
left their testimony to us. Cyprian, a man far removed from all
pride and ambition, shews that this sacerdotal authority osone
Bishop was confirmed by the Divine approbati-on, and immediately
adds, From no other quarter have heresies arisen, or schisms
sprange up, thanfrom this, that they would not render obedience
to the Priest of God, nor think that z'n the place of Christ, there
is one Priest in the Clzurclz at a time, and one Judge at a time:
(Epist. lib. l, epist. 3 ;) Which words are most impudently
wrested by the Romanists to establish the monarchy of the Pope,
when it is clearer than the meridiari light, that the blessed martyr
was speaking of himself, not of the Roman Pontiff. If in the ·
cause of Bishops, the testimony of a Bishop be suspicions, let us
>again hear St. Jerome, who was not wont to (lepre-ss Presbyters, or
exalt Bishops unduly. Thus speaks he against the Luciferians,
Cap. 4. p. 199, The safety of the Church depensis on the diynz‘ly
of the chief Priest, to whom if α certain peculz'ar and eminent
power be not yrcinted by att, there will beformecl in the chzcrches
as many schisms as there are priests. This very singleness of the
episcopal succession, always joined with a certain amplitude of
authority, is sufficient of itself to crush the modern error of the
parity of all ministers.

But we are to add the second mark of Episcopal dignity, viz.
the right and power of ordination, which was transmitted by the
Apostles themselves to Bishops, but denied to inferior I’resbyters.
Both which is clear from hence, that we see the Apostles sent
Timothy and Titus to churches in which there were many Presby-
ters, viz. to Ephesus and. Crete, that they might ordain Presbyters
where there was need. Lay hands suddenly οη no man, is the
admonition of Paul to Timothy (1 Tim. v. 22,) who was endued
with the power of ordination. For this cause left I thee ἐπ Crete,
that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, ancl
ordain Presbyters in every city, are the words of the same Apos-
tle to Titus (i. 5), and referring to the same thing, Why could
not the Ephesian Presbyters ordain others before the arrival of
Timothy 't Why was it not lawful for the Ministers of Crete to do
the like before Titus came? No adequatc reason for this can be
assigned, unless the power of ordaining resides in those alone
