ther, through fear of their not being in safety with our-
selves. When therefore the Apostle calls the kingdom of
heaven the hope laid up sor us, he shews that the godly
ought to be certain of the attainment of life eternal; be-
cause it is as a treasure kept in store for his children by
God himself their Father. Hence that saying of Christ,
Luke xii. 32, Fear not littkflock, for it isyour Father's good
pleasure to give yon the kingdom. Admirably writes Cle-
mens Alexandrinus concerning the certainty of the godly.
Afaitlfful man hath the God whom he has loved; and by saith
has received what is uncertain to others; and he obtains the
promise κρατει επαγγελίας· ; he possessesfuture things as present.-
nay he hath so certain a persnasion, that he makes more sure of

Quaecunque nos inflant mala,-fit mane, nil sunt omnia!

But as these earthly things pass away and vanish, and
have nothing fixed or permanent about them 3 so heavenly

Wealth, honours, or prosperity;
WVhatever evils chafe on earth,
When morning dawns,—as nought they be.

Prudentius wasa Poet of the fourth century, a Spaniard by birth, born
