104 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ΞΤ. PAUL’S Chap. i.

inquire into the dignity of the office itself. A minister qf
Christ: i. e. a minister of the Supreme King of heaven, of
earth, and hell. Not even angels disdain to minister to
and serve this Lord.

But a minister in what? (for this also adds much to the
dignity of the ministry). Not in any mean or abjeet busi-
ness, but in the dispensatim] of the most preoious trea-
sure, viz. Gospel grace. Among the ministers of kings,
the treasurer is accounted one of the most honourable:
how much honour therefore should people attach to those,
through whom the treasure of the grace of the Gospel is
dispensed to men? Such a minister was Epaphras3 and,
therefore, worthy of being loved and honoured by the
Colossians.

From this title, which is given to preachers of the word,
many things may be deduced.

l. Thai, since they are the ministers of Christ, they
may not be despised, or injured with impunity, by any
man. David avenged the injury done to his ambassadors
by the Ammonites, in shaving their beards and cutting off
their garments, 2 Sam. X.; how much more shall Christ
avenge his ambassadors and ministers, if any thing be done
against them injuriously or contumeliously, by Ammonites
amongst us ’ἓ

2. That, since they are ministers of this heavenly King,
it behoves them not to set their hearts upon temporal ad-
vantages, but to look for a heavenly reward. This splen-
did reeompence Christ promises to his servants, Dan. xii.
3, The wise shall shine as the brightness (ff the firmament ; and
they that turn many to rz'glzteousness, as the slarsfor ever and
ever. Upon this crown Paul had his thoughts ever fixed,
2 Tim. iv. 8, There is laid upsor me a croton ‹ffriglzteousness‚
διο.

Faitlfizl] This in a special manner conduces to the
praise of Epaphras. It is a great thing to be a minister of
Christ, i. e. a dispenser of the Gospe13 but as the Apostle
speaks, l Cor. iv. 2, It is required in stewards, or ministers,
that every oue befoundfaithfiil; this faithfulness is partiou-
larly to be noted in two things:
