tend immediate revelations of the Holy Spirit3 yet, that
their notions may not appear destitute of a shew of Divine
wisdom, they are wont to affirm, as it is stated in Irenaeus,
lib. 3. cap. 2, that tlzee'r doctrines were not indeed consignes] in
writing by the Apostles, but delivered to them viva voce,· aco
cording to that saysng, ‘ We spealc wisdom among tlze perfect:⁹
and their 01οηι fictione every] one asset-ts to be this wz'sdom. Thus
says Irenaeus. Therefore human traditions have this shew
of wisdom 011 the part of the impostors.

2. On the part of superstitious and carnal men, they
have a shew of wisdoni, because carnal things are suited to
the taste of carnal meu, but spiritual things are not es-
teemed. Whence that saying of the Apostle, Rom. viii. 7,
lee wisdom of theflesla* is enmity against God,· and 1 Cor.
ii. 5, Yourfaitlz should not stand in tlze zoisdom of men, Imt in
the power of God. For that seems full of wisdom to a car-
nal man, which accords with the nature and disposition of
the fiesh ; and nothing is more pleasing to the carnal mind,
than to have salvation, righteousness, and holiness iu rites
and external things. You see, therefore, how human tra-
ditions have a sltew o] wisdom ‚· namely, l. From the fraud
of impostors, who always boast that they flowed from the
Spirit of wisdom: 2. From the carnal nature of supersti-
tious men, whom it always pleases to seek salvation and
righteousness in rites and external exercises. But, never-
theless, we must hold, that they have the shew only, and,
as it were, a vain shadow of wisdom, not the reality. For,
as Lactantius has truly said, Instit. lib. 4. cap. l, where tlte
reperte offoolislmess appears, there wisdom is Chifi'l to be
souglzl; so we may truly affirm, where to the carnal man
the repute of wisdom appears, there folly is always to be
found. for this wisdom descendetlz not from the Falher of
Ziglcts, but is earthly, sensual, devilz'slz,· James iii. 15.

l. They are to be accounted for impostors who, in the
business of salvation, obtrude upon us doctrines under the
pretence of revelation or tradition, without the testimony
