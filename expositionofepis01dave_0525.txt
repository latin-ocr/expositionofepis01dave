with the sword of the Spirit and the word; for tlte wordcff
God is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing evento the
(lividing asunder qf soul and spirit, δὶα. Heb. iv. 12. It is
quite reasonable, therefore, that the effect of this circum-
cision should be the putting away of the body of the sins
of the flesh, i. e, the cleansing of the soul, not the impress-
ing of a bodily sign.

Hence we learn,

1. That Christ is a Saviour not only by the merits of
his passion, but also by the efficacy of his internal opera-
1i0n3 for he has not only expiated our sins by his blood 3
but he bath renewed our hearts, and washes away the body
of sins Which cleave to our souls, by-his Spirit.

2. Since this spoiling of the body of sins is the work·
of the Spirit of Christ, we ought not to resist this spirit,
but commit our whole selves to be renewed a-nd directed
by the same. The reins of the flesh are, therefore, not to
be loosened, but we must walk in the spirit. Wallc in tlze
spirit, and με shall not fulfil tlze lusts (ff tlte fleslz, Gal.
v. 16.

3. It is not sufficient for the Christian, as it were, to
cut off one or other member of this body of corruption3
but he must needs prune‚ strip off, and cast away the
whole ε for this spiritual circumcision does not pertain to
one member only, but to all. Ears, tongues, eyes, heart,
mind, in short, the whole man must be cil'mimcised, be-
cause the whole is defiled by sin. Rightly says Parisiensis,
De virtut. cap. 22: He is not cleansed‚ except lze laath reuome-
εει] all sin. For wlco will call α man clean that rolls in one
sewer only?

But here a doubt arises concerning the effect of this in-
ternal circumcision : For itseems that that whole body of
sins is not put away from regenerate Christians, as well
because they perceive in themselves yet the motions and
lusts of indwelling sin, as because Scripture commands the
spiritually circumcised‚ i. e, the truly renewed, daily to
mortify more and more the old Adam, to put off the old
man, and to put on the new ε Ephes. iv. 22, 24.
