Verse 22.

The Apostle proves by two other reasons, that neither
the true worship of God, nor thejustification or sanctifi-
cation of a Christian man is placed in the observauce of

fish, or fruits, yon use earthly and transient things, in
which there is no spiritual power to purify or defile the

disprove the false opinion of those who thought that men
become more holy by abstinence from certain kinds of
meats, or worse by the indifferent use of meats of what-
ever kind. Christ himself, in Matth. xv. blamed the Pha-
