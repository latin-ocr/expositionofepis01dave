Hence observe,

1. Since all things made by Christ are also formed for
the glory of Christ, it is incumbent upon us not to dishonour
our Creator, for the manifestation of whose glory we were
created: For if that instrument be accounted useless and
good for nothing, which does not answer its end3 then is
that one evil and execrable which is in opposition, and, as

far as possible, detrimental to the purpose intended by it.
2. Since the angels themselves were created for the
glory of Christ, they must not be so united with him in the

work of salvation‚ as to (detraet from, much less) oppose
the glory of their Creator.

and the Senate, without summoning him to his dese-nce, condemned him to
death. Theodoric, however, apprehending some bad consequences from the
execution of a sentence so flagrantly unjust‚ mitigated it to imprisonment
in a solitary tower at Pavia. In that forlorn state he endeavoured to derive
from philosophy and religion, those comforts which they were capable of af-
fording to one in such a situation3 sequestered from 1115 friends, in the power
of his enemies, and at the mercy of a capricious tyrant; and, accordingly,
he there composed that ‘⁶ golden volume,'’ as a great historiari has terined
it, from which the foregoing lines are quoted. About two years after his
banishment, viz. in Oct. 526, Boethius was put to death, and it is asserted,
in amost barbarous manner. Thus perislied, owing to the spirit of the
times, the first Philosopher, Orator, and Theologian of the sixth century3
and, ρει-1111115, the most genereus, liberal, aud noble-minded man. His
tomb is to be seen in the Church of St. Augustine, at Pavia, but his bones
were removed some years after, by order of Otho, to a more honourable re-
ceptacle.

Boethius wrote several philosophie works, besides the one on Divinity al-
ready mentioned. But his most celebrated performance is ‘⁴ The Consola-
tions of Philosophy²' above cited. Few works have undergone so many edi-
tions, and it has been translated into all cultivated languages. There are
two versions by British Sovereigns; one in Anglo-Saxon by Alfi-ed the
Great‚ and an English'l‘ranslation by Queen Elizabeth. It is to be regret-
ted, however, that it does not embrace the range of Christian consolations
which, from Boethius's knowledge of Christian 'rheology, might have been
expected ς though probably he would have added a book on those firmet· sup-
ports under the “ afflictions of the present time,'' had he been spared a
little longer; since his work is evidently unfinished, and there is an order
111 the topics leading to that supposition.
