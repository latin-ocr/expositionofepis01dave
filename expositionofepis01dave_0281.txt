Ver. 16. EPISTLE To THE cotossmns. 195

Hugh de St. Victori* in Sum. Sentent. tract. ii. cap. 5,
distributes the heavenly angels into three classes orhierar-
chies, which he terms the highest, the middle, and the
lowest. Each of these he subdivides into three orders.
In the highest are cherubim, seraphim, and thrones .· In the
middle class are dominions,principalities, and powers .· In the
lowest are virtues, archwgels, and angels.

Now these titles they are pleased to attach to the angels,

· Hugh de St.Victor, or Cardinal Hugo: a Divine who lived in the early
part of the twelfth century; a native of Flanders, a Monk of the Domi-
nican order, and the first Monk that was made a Cardinal. He settled in
Paris, where he became Prior of St. Victor, and, with the assistance of 500
other Monks, formed a Concordance of the Bible; but died at the early
age of 44, distinguished by his learning and genius, and obtaining such re-
putation by his works (consisting of Commentaries on Scripture, Sermons,
Dialogues, &c.)‚ as to be called a second Angustiae, and sometimes, from his
close adherence to the doctrine and imitation of the style of that Father‚
tlte tangue ofAugastine. He held the Protestant doctrine respecting the Apo-
cryphal books: “Non ad probationem fidei, sed ad morum instructionem ;'' and
he defended the Canon of scripture against those who would introduce apo·
cryphal books as true ἔ His ivorks were printed at Rouen in 1648, in three
vols. folio.
