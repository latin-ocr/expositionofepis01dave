Ver. 17. EPISTLE To THE COLossxANs. 207

volves a contradiction therefore, that God should commu-
nicate to any creature an existence independent of himself:
for this would be, in fact, to place it above the condition
of a creature.

2 It is objected, There are some created things which
cannot but continue, inasmuch as they have in themselves
neither the power of assuming a new form, or the con-
trary; of this kind are all the heavenly bodies: these,
therefore, at least, may continue in their state, even if the
Divine conservation were withdrawn.

We answer, The consequence does not hold: because
although the heavenly bodies have no natural power what-
ever of assuming a new form, neither is there any thing
external which may effect their dissolution‚ yet would their
very form and substance cease and vanishaway, if the,
Divine conservation were to cease. For this liability of
created things to dissolution (or non-entity) depends nei-
ther upon the nature of the material, or of the form, but
upon God's withdrawing his influence. This objection may
also be answered by a distinction in the mode of conser-
vation. For there is an indirect conservation‚ viz, by remo-
val of the destructive principle: this the heavenly bodies
do not require, but only the elementary and corruptible
things. As far as this is concerned the objection is al—
lowed. But there is a direct conservation of which we are
now treating‚ through the immediate upholding of the
Creator: and of this preservation, both the heavens, and
every other being dependant on the First Being, stand in
need.

3. They object, Every creature hath an innate earnest
desire of its own preservation: but no natural desire is
either vain or impossible : therefore every creature has the
power of self-preservation.

It is answered, The creature seeks its own preservation,
but not to be preserved of itself and by its own powers, but
by that very Cause which gave it its existence. Therefore

the desire is not vai11; for it gains its end by the proper
means.
