visible God. Bnt that image was the eternal Son of God,
the incarnate Word : Therefore Christ, the God-man, is the
head of the Church. For the Church ought to possess such
a head as might have a natural conformity with the rest of
the members to be incorporated in it. Now this confor-
mity suits Christ according to his human nature; whence

Christ and the Church are called one fleslz, Ephes. v. 31.
But it was also necessary that the Church should have such

a head as could infuse into it spiritual life. Now this is
the province of God alone3 whence God is plainly called
the husband and tlte lzead of the Church, Psalm xlv. lO,
where, under the representation of the marriage of Solo-
mon with Pharaoh’s daughter, the espousals of Christ and
the Church are prefigured 3 Hem-ken, Ο daughter, and consi·

Ilii is, however, objected, That Christ was not the head

of the ancient Church in each nature, because he had not
yet assumed human nature. But it is the office of the head
to impart and communicate its excellencies to the body;
and the human nature of Christ could not benefit the
Church before his incarnation3 because that which does
not exist cannot operate. Therefore he was not the head of
the Jewish church as to his humanity.

We answer, Although Christ had not yet actually united
the human nature to his own3 nevertheless, as to the Di-
vine decree respecting his future incarnation and passi0n3
as to the eternal efficacy thereof3 and as to the living saith
of the Patriarchs3 even the human nature of Christ, and
that which he was to do and suffer in human nature, al-
though not actually undergone‚ produced many benefits to
the ancient Church. All believers, being elect in Christ,

from thefoundation of the world, are, through Christ, adop-
ted into the family of God, Ephes. i. 4, 5. God, therefore,
by reason of his eternal purpose concerning the incarnation
of Christ, even then accounted as members ofhis body all
who believed in him. He was the Lambslaz‘nfrom thefoun-
