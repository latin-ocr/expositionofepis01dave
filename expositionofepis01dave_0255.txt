his hands whoxnsoever he might think fit. Therefore after
that the devil was overcome by the death of Christ in a
way of justice, and deprived of his possessions by the Di-
vine decree ; then Christ, having triumphed over him, took
from him, by an irresistible arm, his own elect, and tram-
pled him not only under his own feet, but under the feet
of all his people. Thus the devil was vanquished by the
death and blood of Christ, and we are rescued from his
jaws.

To this doctrine both the Scriptures and the Fathers
bear testimony. God foretold this victorious death of
Christ, Gen. iii. 15, Ι will put enmity between thy seed and
between the seed of the woman.- It shall bruise thy head, and
thou shalt bruise his heel. And in Isa. liii. 12, He shall di-
vide the spoils of the strong& because he hath ponred out his
soul anto death. He suffered his innocent soul† to be forced
from him, that he might deliver our guilty souls from the
power of the devil. Augusfine, lib. xiii. De Trin. cap. 14,
What is the righteousness by which the devil was conquered ?
What but the righteousness of= Jesus Christ? And how was
he conquered? Because, though he couldfind in him nothing
worthzs of death, nevertheless he slew him. And vet-ily z‘t was
just that he should let go the debtors whom he held, because they
believed in him whom, without owing any debt, he slew. And
cap. 15, In redempteon, the blood of Christ is given as a ran-
som, as it were‚for as ,· which being accepted, the devil is not
enriched, but bound, that we might be freed from his bonds.
