4 AN EXPOSITION oF sT. PAUL’S Chap. i.

Secondly, who had received a certain and infallible know-
ledge of evangelio-al doctrine, by the immediate inspiration
of the Holy Spirit. Christ promised this to them, John
xvi. 13, 'lee Spirit eff trutlz shall guide you inco all trutlm
this he fulfilled in Acts iifl? Thirdly, who had received an
authority, not restricted to one place, or to a certain
church, but plenary and universa13 Teaclz allmztz'ons, Matth.
xxviii. Preach to every creature, Mark xvi. Now it is evi-
dent that Paul possessed all these. His immediate call is
proved from Acts ix. 15, The Lord said to him (i. e. to Ana-
nias, who had hesitated to seek Paul) Go thy way, for lle
is α chosen vessel unto me3 and Gal. i. 1. Η15 immediate
inspiration of the mystery of the Gospel, from Gal. i. 12,
Ι was vot taught it, but bis the revelation of Jesas Christ.
His universal authority, from Acts ix. 15, where 116 15 called
a chosen vessel to bear tlze name of God before tlte Gentiles atad
the Clzildren of Israel. And elsewhere he is termed tlze
macher, not of this or of that church, but of tlze Gentiles,
Rom. i. 5.

We have thus proved the Apostlesbip of Paul. Now let
us inquire why in this place, and several others, he makes
mention of this his office. First, he does it that he might
silence the false Apostles, who whispered 111 1116 ears of the
people that he was not one of the ApostleS‚ because he
had no intercourse with Christ whilst he dwelt upon earth,
and because 116 was not among them when the Holy spirit
111 1116 1111611655 of tongues of fire sat upon each o'f them.
But notwithstanding this, he styles and proves himself an
Apostle, because he was directly called and instructed by
Christ, although not at the same time as the rest.

Secondly, he claims the title of an Apostle, that he might
make known to the faithful themselves the certainty of his
doctrine. For it is absolutely necessary that it should be
known whence that doctrine proceeded which is delivered
to the Churches; if from human opinion, it cannot be sure
and infallible3 but if from the ambassadors of God him-
self, and men inspired by the Holy spirit for this work of
