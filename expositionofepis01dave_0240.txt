154 AN ExposiTioN OF ST. PAUL'S Chap. i.

John iii. Therefore it is properly said by the Schoolmen,
The whole T rim'ty redeemecl man by an act <ff power ,· the in-
carnate Son redeemecl him by the ffel of his lnmzz‘liatebn.
And no one else ought to, or could, deliver man, except
God alone3 of whose power and will he was created out of
nothing. None other ought, because (as Tertullian well
observes) by this act he would forcibly take awaysrom the
Creator his own servant. For so great is this benefit of de-
liverance, that it binds us more than the benefit of creation
itself. If, therefore, one had made us and another had
delivered us, we should have been more strictly bound to
that other deliverer than to God the Creator. Hence also
another remark of Tertullian, Who ought to seek the lost
sheep ,9 Ouglzt not he who lost it ? Who lost it ,9 Was it not
he who possessed z't ,9 W ho possessed <it ? Was it not he who
created z't 2? But neither could any other deliver. For he
must necessarily be strengel· than the devil who could
wrest his prey from him: For no one can enter into a strong
mcm's house ancl sez'ze lzz's goocls, unless he shall have first bound
the strong man, and then he shall spoz'l his hozcse; Matth.
xii. 29. But who could overcome and bind this prince of
darkness who was holding us captive, except the {eighty
God alone? It was he, therefore, who plucked us from
him.

Us.] We must consider, in the second place, Whom, or
what smt of persons God delivered. And this considera-
tion may be twofold3 of those who were to be delivered, οι
of those who have b’een delivered.

While we were to be deliveiffed i. e. previous to our deli-
verance, we were not only (liseased and weak, but were
openly and secretly opposed to our own deliverance.
