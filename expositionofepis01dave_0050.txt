were at unity before, and to make them fight like cocks which are
all of afeather‚ and yet never at peace with themselves.” Yet
Davenant, when the question came officially before him, decided
in favour of the Primate's injunction on the subject. “ Nor,’' says
Heylin, “ did the Archbishop stand alone in point of judgment as
to these particulars. He had therein the testimony and assent of
two such Bishops‚* than which there could be none more averse
from Popery, or any thing that tended to it. A difference hap-
pening between the minister and churchwardens, in a parish of
Wilts, about the placing of the table, which the minister desired
to transpose to the end of the Church, and the churchwardens to
keep as it stood before, the business was referred to Davenant,
then Bishop of Salisbury, who, on a full consideration of the
matter, decided in favour of the Incumbent3 and, by a decree
under 1115 episcopal seal, settled the table in the place where the
altar stood, as the minister desired to have it. In which decree
there are these two passages to be observed: First, that, ‘ by the
injunction of Queen Elizabeffl, and by Canon xxxii. under King
James, the communion-table should ordinarily be set and stand
with the side to the east wall of the Chanceh’ and, secondly,
that ‘ It is ignorance to think that the standing of the holy table
in that place doth relish of Popery.' '’† Here we perceive the cool
judgmentof Daveuant opposed, in a point of discipline, to those
with whose doctrinal tenets be agreed, and supporting Laud, whose
views and conduct he doubtless disapproved. Few measures were
more unpopular than this enforced conformity about the position
of the Lord's table; and when Laud first introduced the altera-
tion in Gloucester Cathedral, upon being appointed Deam, his
Diocesan, the venerable and learned Miles sorith, never entered
the Church afterwards.

One of the last occasions in which we hear of Davenant in pub—
lic, was in 1640, the year before 1115 death : when the convocation
under the direction of Archbishop Laud, passed certain Canons‚
principally for the enforcement of uniform discipline3 which, al-
though unobjectionable in themselves, were extremely ill-timed;
being at a moment when the Church was scarcely able to sustain
even her existence: and so it was that the passing of these Canons
was made a handle to hasten her destruction. All the Prelates
