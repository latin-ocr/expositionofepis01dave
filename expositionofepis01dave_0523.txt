ped of all salutary efficacy: for Christ is the substance of
the sacraments3 the virtue and operation of Christ is the
very life of the sacraments. That saying of the schools is,
therefore, a sensible ancl sound one, Sacraments represent by
similitude; signffy by institution ,· but sanctffiygby‘sslhe virtue of
Christ.

2. If, as an outward administration of the sacraments
is made by the hands of men, so an inward operation is
wrought hythe sole power of Christ; then it is vain to
seek grace as though it were hidden in the signs them-
selves, or attached to the performance of them, i. e. to the
outward administration of the sacraments: for it is to
Christ alone, not to those external rites. Parisiensis has
learnedly written on this matter in Tract de sacram. bapt.'
cap. 2, where he shews that the external solemnity of the

assistance of a haman. ministris, bat the virtue proceeds through
the efficacy osa Divz'ne work. More succinctly does Cyprian
state it, De bapt. The sz'rit alone imparts the reality (ff thc
sacrament to us.

3. We must not glory because we are made partakers of
the external sacrament, unless we obtain besides the inter-
nal and quickening work of Christ: for if this be wanting,
as it was heretofore said to the Jews, Acts vii. 51, ch
¹uncircnmcised in heart‚ so it may be justly said to us, Ο ye
unbaptized in heart.

4. The external administration of the sacraments is not
to be despised, although the quickening and saving effect
is to be expected neither from the human ministry, nor
-from the external signs, but from the Spirit of Christ: be-
cause Christ concurs with his institution, nor wills us to
seek that grace from him which he promised, if we de-
spise the sacraments of grace which he has directed to be
used by us.-—And thus much concerning the mode or qua-
