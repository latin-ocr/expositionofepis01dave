Ver. 12. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 1219

Grace is not given unless to those who have an aptitudefor
grace.

But to these we oppose plain Scriptum, which every-
where teaches that God ιὶκανοῖσαι, i. e. readers us srffcient
and meet for spiritual and heavenly things, since of ou-r-
seives we are most unmeet, either to receive or ¹perform
them. Against these also we place in opposition the more
sound of the Schoolmen: Free—will, says Aquinas, is not
the cause of grace, by means osan adequate disposition. God,
observes Parisiensis, previously confers upon us om· efforts
and preparations, that he may afterwards render them more
profitable. And again, Although I am moved towards thee,

O Lord, butfaintly and wealcly ,· yet am I not moved at all,
but by Thee, when drawn towards Thee. Idem.

must needs be added the interna! operation os God, which

of grace and salvation is common to all through the
preaching of the Gospel ; but that internal efficacious
operation, which fits and qualifies us to lay hold upon sal-
vation, is peculiar to the elect. All that the Father gii-ech

the Spirit (f crath, John xiv. 17. Whence also that in
Acts xiii. 48, As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
Augustine acknowledges this peculiar operation of God in
the case of the elect, De praedest. sanct. lib. i. cap. 16,
They who attain to the vocation according to the purpose, must
all be taught of God, neither can any one of them say, l have
believed, that thereby I might be called :sor Ι have been called
by the mercis of God to believe. God does not worlc in us to
will and to do good, because by precepts exter-really given he
speaks inwaidly upon our sehses, but because he inwardly sheds
abroad his love in our hearts. Idem, De spirit. de lit. cap.
25.

3. No one from the merit of inherent righteousness, or
of his good works, can claim to himself the lot of the
saints : For how can we force our righteousness upon God,
