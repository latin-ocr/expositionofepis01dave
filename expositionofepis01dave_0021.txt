21?ss OF BIsIIOP DAVENAN'T. X‘t

right side, and on the contrary. Those things will be living to
the memory of the longest survivor that ever heard him. In this
trial, wherein he stood now to be judged by so many attic and
exquisite ‹wits‚ he strived to exceed himself, and shewed his cun-
ning marvellously that he could invalidate every argument brought
against him with variety of answers. It was well for all sides,
that the best divine, in my jndgment, that ever was in that place,
Dr. Davenant‚ held the reins of the disputation. He kept him
within the even boundals of the cause3 he oharmed him with the
Caducaean wand of dialectical prudence; he ordered him to give
just -weighsst, and no more. Horat. 1. 1. Od. 3. Quo non arbiter
Adriae major, tollere seuflonere vultfreta. Such an arbiter as he
was now, such he was and no less, year by year, in all comitial
disputations; wherein whosoever did well, yet constantly he had
the greatest acclamation. To the close of all this Emi-eise, Icome. ⁴
'The grave elder opponents having had their courses, Mr.WilliamS‚
a new admitted Bachelor of Divinity, came to his turn, last of all.
Presently, there was a smile in the face of every one that knew
them both, and a pre-judging that between these two there would
be a fray indeed. Both jealous of their eredit, both great masters
of wit3 and as much was expected from the one as from the other.
So they fell to it with all quiekness and pertinency; yet, thank
the Moderator, with all candour3 like Fabius and Marcellus, the
*one was the buckler, the other the sword of that learned exere-ise.
No greyhound did ever give a hare more turns upon Newmarket
-heath, than the replier with his subtleties gave to the respondent.
A subject fit for the verse of Mr. Abraham Hartwell, in his Reyz'na
Literata, as he extols Dr. Pern's arguments made before Queen
Elizabeth: Quis fulmine tanto tela jacet? tanto fulmine nemo
jacet. But when they had both done their best with equal prow-
ess, the Marshal of the Field, Dr. Davenant, cast down his war—
dei· between them, and parted them.'’

In 1614 116 was chosen President of his College. And stand-
ing now in the highest rank of English Divines for learning, elo-
quenee, and judgment, he was selected, in 1618, by King James
1.‚ with four other theologians of the first name in the kingdom,
to represent the British Chureh, and assist at the deliberations of
the Synod of Dort; to which assembly his Majesty had been in-
-vited to send deputies. And here it will be necessary to take a
brief survey of the circumstances which led to the convening of
this famous Couneil.
