deceitful impostors.·—Thus much concerning the two marks
which are branded on these seducers.

In humility and worslzippz'ng of angela] Some explain
these words of the pretended humility of the seducers
themselves, and of a certain new worship which they seign-
ed to have been made known to them by angelic revela·-
nous. But (as we noted at the beginning) the opinion of
the antients is the more probable, which most of our own
writers, and even of the PapistS, follow3 viz. that the
Apostle spake of a certain preposterous humility, and wor-
ship of the angels themselves, to which they attempted to
persuade Christ-iaus.

But these words, in a humility and worshipping af angels, .
are connected3 because, under the pretext of humility,
they introduced that worship. For they argued, that we
were unworthy to approach God directly3 therefore, the
intercession of angels was to be solicited, and that they
were to beinvoked to conduct us to God. As to the lzumz'·
lc'y, then, or lowliness of mind, we must understand that
it was not a true and laudable‚ but a preposterous aud su-
perstitious humility, forced upon the minds of Christians,
by those seducers- Now I call that preposterous which
makes a man dejected in what he ought to bejoyfu13 or
which dimiuishes aud lessens his confidence in those
things in which it is laudable to have the greatest confi-
dence. Such a humility, theu, they induce, who wish us
on account of our unworthiness, not to implore forthwith
the power and assistance of our God-man Mediator, but to
go first to angels or saints.

But this foolish lowliness of mind is rightly reproved,
because Christ himself is more united to us both by na-
ture and love than the angels;·and the Scriptures command
us to go unto him with boldness, and to no other Media-
tor: Rom. v. 2, Bywlzom we lzave ασκεω and Ephes. iii. 12,
In whom we have boldness, and access with corffidence by the

faula of lzim; aud Heb. iv. 16, Let us come with hokinessnnto
the throne (ffb orace. For he, therefore, humbled himself,
aud took oui nature, that we might approach him the more
boldly as our elder brother: I can spealc more scgfely‚ says
