lead its members to final blessedness. So spake Christ,
John xvii. 12, Those that thou gavest me 1 have kept, and none
of them is lost. Hence he is called the Saviour <ff his body,
Ephes. v. 23. This also is the object proposed to all the
members of Christ, to attain to the participation of this
blessedness together with their head, For what was the
purpose and sentiment of Paul, the same is that of all the
faithful, One thing I do, forgettz'ng those things which are be-
hind, and reaching forth unco those things which are before, I
press towards the mark, &c. Phil. iii. 4.

in the circumstance of their having a continuous union
with each other, and all of them deriving their motion and
intellectuality from the same soul. So this mystical head,
and all the members of it, have a certain mutual continuity„
and have their spiritual intellectuality and vivifying princi-

all the members of Christ, a certain uninterrupted union
by means of the Holy spirit, who, in all its plenitude,
dwelling in Christ the head, being one and the same nume-
rically, is shed forth among all his members, quickening
each separately and uniting all in one body. Thus most
clearly does the Apostle speak, Ephes. iv. 16, The zvhole
body fitlyjoined together, and compacted by that which every
joint suppliet'h, according to tlte effectnal working in the mea-
sure (ff every part, mahetlz increase (ff the body anto the edffy—

These are particulars in which there is agreement of the
head with the members. And hence it follows that Christ
is the true and living head of the whole Church, both in
those respects in which 1116 head ought to differ from, as
well as in those in which it ought to agree with, its mem-
bers.

the last place, who and what they are, out of whom this

body of Christ is composed, which in this place is called
the Clzurclz.

The term Clmrch is derived from a word signifying to
